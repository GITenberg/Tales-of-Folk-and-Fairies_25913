<h2>THE MEESTER STOORWORM</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Story from Scotland</span></h3>
</div>

<p>There was once a lad, and what his real
name was nobody remembered, unless it was
the mother who bore him; but what every
one called him was Ashipattle. They called
him that because he sat among the ashes to
warm his toes.
</p>
<p>He had six older brothers, and they did not
think much of him. All the tasks they scorned
to do themselves they put upon Ashipattle.
He gathered the sticks for the fire, he swept
the floor, he cleaned the byre, he ran the errands,
and all he got for his pains were kicks
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
and cuffs and mocking words. Still he was a
merry fellow, and as far as words went he
gave his brothers as good as they sent.
</p>
<p>Ashipattle had one sister, and she was very
good and kind to him. In return for her
kindness he told her long stories of trolls and
giants and heroes and brave deeds, and as
long as he would tell she would sit and listen.
But his brothers could not stand his stories,
and used to throw clods at him to make him
be quiet. They were angry because Ashipattle
was always the hero of his own stories,
and in his tales there was nothing he dared
not do.
</p>
<p>Now while Ashipattle was still a lad, but a
tall, stout one, a great misfortune fell upon
the kingdom, for a Stoorworm rose up out of
the sea; and of all Stoorworms it was the
greatest and the worst. For this reason it
was called the Meester Stoorworm. Its length
stretched half around the world, its one eye
was as red as fire, and its breath was so poisonous
that whatever it breathed upon was withered.
</p>
<p>There was great fear and lamentation throughout
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
the land because of the worm, for every day
it drew nearer to the shore, and every day the
danger from it grew greater. When it was first
discovered it was so far away that its back was
no more than a low, long, black line upon the
horizon, but soon it was near enough for them
to see the horns upon its back, and its scales,
and its one fierce eye, and its nostrils that
breathed out and in.
</p>
<p>In their fear the people cried upon the King
to save them from the monster, but the King
had no power to save them more than any
other man. His sword, Snickersnapper, was
the brightest and sharpest and most wonderful
sword in all the world, but it would need a
longer sword than Snickersnapper to pierce
through that great body to the monster&#8217;s heart.
The King summoned his councillors,&mdash;all the
wisest men in the kingdom,&mdash;and they consulted
and talked together, but none of them
could think of any plan to beat or drive the
Stoorworm off, so powerful it was.
</p>
<p>Now there was in that country a sorcerer,
and the King had no love for him. Still, when
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
all the wisemen and councillors could think of
no plan for destroying the Stoorworm, the
King said, &#8220;Let us send for this sorcerer, and
have him brought before us, and hear what
he has to say; for &#8217;twould seem there is no
help in any of us for this evil that has come
upon us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So the sorcerer was brought, and he stood
up in the council and looked from one to another.
Last of all he looked at the King, and there his
eyes rested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one way, and only one,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;by which the land can be saved from destruction.
Let the King&#8217;s only daughter, the
Princess Gemlovely, be given to the Stoorworm
as a sacrifice, and he will be satisfied
and quit us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>No sooner had the sorcerer said this than a
great tumult arose in the council. The councillors
were filled with horror, and cried aloud
that the sorcerer should be torn to pieces for
speaking such words.
</p>
<p>But the King arose and bade them be silent,&mdash;and
he was as white as death.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is this the only way to save my people?&#8221;
he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the only way I know of,&#8221; answered
the sorcerer.
</p>
<p>The King stood still and white for a time.
&#8220;Then,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if it is the only way, so let
it be. But first let it be proclaimed, far and
wide throughout my kingdom, that there is
an heroic deed to be done. Whosoever will do
battle with the Stoorworm and slay it, or drive
it off, shall have the Princess Gemlovely for a
bride, and the half of my kingdom, and my
sword Snickersnapper for his own; and after
my death he shall rule as king over all the
realm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the King dismissed the Council, and
they went away in silence, with dark and
heavy looks.
</p>
<p>A proclamation was sent out as the King
commanded, saying that whoever could kill
the Stoorworm or drive it away should have
the Princess, and the half of the kingdom as a
reward, and the King&#8217;s sword, and after the
King&#8217;s death should reign over the whole realm.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></p>
<p>When this news went out many a man wished
he might win these three prizes for himself,
for what better was there to be desired than a
beauteous wife, a kingdom to reign over, and
the most famous sword in all the world. But
fine as were the prizes, only six-and-thirty
bold hearts came to offer themselves for the
task, so great was the fear of the Stoorworm.
Of this number the first twelve who looked at
the Stoorworm fell ill at sight of him and had
to be carried home. The next twelve did not
stay to be carried, but ran home on their own
legs and shut themselves up in strong fortresses;
and the last twelve stayed at the King&#8217;s palace
with their hearts in their stomachs, and their
wrists too weak with fear to strike a blow, even
to win a kingdom.
</p>
<p>So there was nothing left but for the Princess
to be offered up to the Stoorworm, for it was
better that one should be lost, even though
that one were the Princess, than that the
whole country should be destroyed.
</p>
<p>Then there was great grief and lamenting
throughout the land, for the Princess Gemlovely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
was so kind and gentle that she was
beloved by all, both high and low. Only
Ashipattle heard it all unmoved. He said
nothing, but sat by the fire and thought and
thought, and what his thoughts were he told
to nobody.
</p>
<p>The day was set when the Princess was to
be offered up to the Stoorworm, and the night
before there was a great feast at the palace,
but a sad feast it was. Little was eaten and
less was said. The King sat with his back to
the light and bit his fingers, and no one dared
to speak to him.
</p>
<p>In the poorer houses there was a great stir
and bustle and laying out of coats and dresses,
for many were planning to go to the seashore
to see the Princess offered up to the Stoorworm,&mdash;though
a gruesome sight &#8217;twould be to see.
Ashipattle&#8217;s father and brothers were planning
to go with the rest, but his mother and sister
wept, and said they would not see it for anything
in the world.
</p>
<p>Now Ashipattle&#8217;s father had a horse named
Feetgong, and he was not much to look at.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
Nevertheless the farmer treasured him, and it
was not often he would let any one use him but
himself. When the farmer rode Feetgong he
could make him go like the wind,&mdash;none
faster,&mdash;and that without beating him, either.
Then when the farmer wished him to stop
Feetgong would stand as still as though he
were frozen to the ground; no one could make
him budge. But if any one other than the
farmer rode him, then it was quite different.
Feetgong would jog along, and not even a
beating would drive him faster, and then if
one wanted him to stop that was as hard to
do as it was to start him. Ashipattle was
sure there was some secret about this; that
his father had a way to make him go that no
one knew about; but what that way was he
could not find out.
</p>
<p>The day before the beauteous Gemlovely
was to be sacrificed Ashipattle said to his
mother, &#8220;Tell me something; how is it that
Feetgong will not go for you or my brothers
or any one, but when my father mounts him
he goes like the wind,&mdash;none faster?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>Then his mother answered, &#8220;Indeed, I do not
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems a strange thing that my father
would not tell you that,&#8221; said Ashipattle,
&#8220;and you his own true wife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>To this his mother answered nothing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A strange thing,&#8221; said Ashipattle; &#8220;and
in all the years you&#8217;ve lived together not a
thing have you kept back from him, whether
he wished it or no. But even a good husband
always holds back some secret from his wife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Still his mother spoke never a word, but
Ashipattle could see that she was thinking.
</p>
<p>That night Ashipattle lay awake long after
the others were asleep. He heard his father
snoring and his brothers, too, but it seemed
his mother could not sleep. She turned and
twisted and sighed aloud, until at last she
awakened her husband.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What ails you,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;that you turn
and twist in bed and sigh so loud that a body
scarce can sleep.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no wonder I sigh and cannot sleep,&#8221;
answered his wife. &#8220;I have been thinking and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
turning things over in my mind, and I can see
very plainly that you do not love me as a good
husband should love his wife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you say that?&#8221; asked her husband.
&#8220;Have I not treated you well in all these years?
Have I not shown my love in every way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but you do not trust me,&#8221; said his
wife. &#8220;You do not tell me what is in your
heart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What have I not told you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have never told me about Feetgong;
you have never told me why it is that he goes
like the wind whenever you mount him, and
when any one else rides him he is so slow there
is no getting anywhere with him.&#8221; Then she
began to sob as if her heart would break. &#8220;You
do not trust me,&#8221; said she.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, wait!&#8221; cried the Goodman. &#8220;That
is a secret I had never thought to tell any one,
but since you have set your heart on knowing&mdash;listen!
Only you must promise not to tell a
living soul what I tell you now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His wife promised.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then this is it,&#8221; said her husband. &#8220;When
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
I want Feetgong to go moderately fast I slap
him on the right shoulder; when I want him to
stop I slap him on the left shoulder, and when
I want him to go like the wind I blow upon
the dried windpipe of a goose that I always
carry in the right-hand pocket of my coat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now indeed I know that you love me when
you tell me this,&#8221; said his wife. And then
she went to sleep, for she was satisfied.
</p>
<p>Ashipattle waited until near morning, and
then he arose and dressed himself. He put
on the coat of one brother, and the breeches
of another, and the shoes of a third, and so
on, for his own clothes were nothing but rags.
He felt in the right-hand pocket of his father&#8217;s
coat, and there, sure enough, he found the
dried windpipe of a goose. He took that and he
took a pot of burning peat, and covered it over
so it would keep hot; and he took also a big
kitchen knife. Then he went out and led
Feetgong from the stable. He sprang upon
his back and slapped him on the right shoulder,
and away they went.
</p>
<p>The noise awoke the goodman and he jumped
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
from bed and ran to the window. There was
some one riding away on his dear Feetgong.
Then he called out at the top of his voice:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Hie! Hie! Ho!</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Feetgong, whoa!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>When Feetgong heard his master calling he
stopped and stood stockstill. But Ashipattle
whipped out the dried windpipe of the goose
and blew upon it, and away went Feetgong
like the wind; none could go faster. No one
could overtake them.
</p>
<p>After a while, and not so long either, they
came to the seashore, and there, a little way
out from the shore, lay the King&#8217;s own boat
with the boatman in it. He was keeping the
boat there until day dawned. Then the King
and his court would come, bringing the beauteous
Gemlovely to offer up to the Stoorworm. They
would put her in the boat and set the sails to
carry her toward him.
</p>
<p>Ashipattle looked out across the water, and
he could see the black back of the beast rising
out of the sea like a long low mountain.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>He lighted down from Feetgong and called
across the water to the boatman, &#8220;Hello,
friend! How fares it with you out there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bitterly, bitterly!&#8221; answered the boatman.
&#8220;Here I sit and freeze all night, for it is cold
on the water, and not a soul except myself but
what is safe asleep in a good warm bed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a fire here in the pot,&#8221; called Ashipattle.
&#8220;Draw your boat in to shore and
come and warm yourself, for I can see even
from here that you are almost perished.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That I may not do,&#8221; answered the man.
&#8220;The King and his court may come at any
time now, and they must find me ready and
waiting for them as the commands were.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Ashipattle put his pot down on the
shore and stood and thought a bit. Suddenly
he dropped on his knees and began to dig in
the sand as though he had gone mad. &#8220;Gold!
Gold!&#8221; he shouted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; called the boatman.
&#8220;What have you found?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gold! Gold!&#8221; shouted Ashipattle, digging
faster than ever.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>The boatman thought Ashipattle must certainly
have found a treasure in the sand. He
made haste to bring the boat to land. He
sprang out upon the shore, and pushing Ashipattle
aside, he dropped on his knees and began
to scoop out the sand. But Ashipattle did not
wait to see whether he found anything. He
caught up the pot and leaped into the boat,
and before the boatman could stop him he
pushed off from the shore.
</p>
<p>Too late the boatman saw what he was
doing. He ran down to the edge of the water
and shouted and stormed and cried to Ashipattle
to come back, but Ashipattle paid
no heed to him. He never even turned his
head. He set the sail and steered over toward
where the great monster lay, with the waves
washing up and breaking into foam against
him.
</p>
<p>And now the dawn was breaking. It was
time for the monster to awake, and down the
road from the castle came riding the King and
all his court, and the Princess Gemlovely rode
among them on a milk-white horse. All the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
color was gone from her face, and she looked as
white as snow.
</p>
<p>When the King and all the others reached
the shore there stood the boatman, wringing
his hands and lamenting, and the boat was
gone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this?&#8221; asked the King. &#8220;What
have you done with my boat, and why are you
standing here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look! Look!&#8221; cried the boatman and he
pointed out to sea.
</p>
<p>The King looked, and then first he saw Ashipattle
in the boat, sailing away toward the
monster,&mdash;for before his eyes had been dim
with sorrow, and he had seen naught but what
was close before him.
</p>
<p>The King looked, and all the court looked
with him, and a great cry arose, for they guessed
that Ashipattle was sailing out to do battle with
the Stoorworm.
</p>
<p>As they stood staring the sun shone red and
the monster awoke. Slowly, slowly his great
jaws opened in a yawn, and as he yawned the
water rushed into his mouth like a great flood
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
and on down his throat. Ashipattle&#8217;s boat was
caught in the swirl and swept forward faster
than any sail could carry it. Then slowly the
monster closed his mouth and all was still save
for the foaming and surging of the waters.
</p>
<p>Ashipattle steered his boat close in against
the monster&#8217;s jaws, and it lay there, rocking
in the tide, while he waited for the Stoorworm
to yawn again.
</p>
<p>Presently slowly, slowly, the great jaws gaped,
and the flood rushed in, foaming. Ashipattle&#8217;s
boat was swept in with the water, and it almost
crushed against one of the monster&#8217;s teeth, but
Ashipattle fended it off, and it was carried on
the flood down into the Stoorworm&#8217;s throat.
</p>
<p>Down and down went the boat with Ashipattle
in it and the sound of surging waters filled
his ears. It was light there in the monster&#8217;s
throat, for the roof and the sides of it shone
with phosphorescence so that he could see
everything.
</p>
<p>As he swept on, the roof above him grew
lower and lower, and the water grew shallower
and shallower; for it drained off into passages
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
that opened off from the throat into the rest
of the body.
</p>
<p>At last the roof grew so low that the mast of
the boat wedged against it. Then Ashipattle
stepped over the side of the boat into the water,
and it had grown so shallow it was scarce as
high as his knees. He took the pot of peat,
that was still hot, and the knife, and went a
little further until he came to where the beast&#8217;s
heart was. He could see it beat, beat, beating.
</p>
<p>Ashipattle took his knife and dug a hole in
the heart, and emptied the hot peat into it.
Then he blew and blew on the peat. He blew
until his cheeks almost cracked with blowing,
and it seemed as though the peat would never
burn. But at last it flared up; the oil of the
heart trickled down upon it, and the flame
burst into a blaze. Higher and higher waxed
the fire. All the heart shone red with the light
of it.
</p>
<p>Then the lad ran back and jumped into the
boat and pushed it clear of the roof. And
none too soon, for as the fire burned deeper
into the heart, the monster felt the burn of it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
and began to writhe and twist. Then he gave
a great cough that sent the waters surging back
out of his body and into the sea again in a
mighty flood.
</p>
<p>Ashipattle&#8217;s boat was caught in the rush and
swept like a straw up out of the Stoorworm&#8217;s
throat and into the light of day. The monster
spewed him and his boat all the way across the
sea and up on the shore, almost at the King&#8217;s
feet.
</p>
<p>The King himself sprang from his steed and
ran and helped Ashipattle to his feet. Then
every one fled back to a high hill, for the sea
was rising in a mighty flood with the beating
and tossing of the Stoorworm.
</p>
<p>Then began such a sight as never was seen
before and perchance will never be seen again.
For first the monster flung his tail so high that
it seemed as though it would strike the sun
from the sky. And next it fell into the sea
with such a slap as sent the waves high up the
rocks; and now it was his head that flung aloft,
and the tongue caught on the point of the
crescent moon and hung there, and for a while
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
it looked as though the moon would be pulled
from the sky, but it stood firm, and the
monster&#8217;s tongue tore, so that the head dropped
back into the sea with such force that the teeth
flew out of its mouth, and these teeth became
the Orkney Islands.
</p>
<p>Again its head reared high and fell back, and
more teeth flew out, and these became the
Shetland Islands. The third time his head
rose and fell, and teeth flew out; they became
the Faroe Islands.
</p>
<p>So the monster beat and threshed and
struggled, while the King and the Princess
and Ashipattle and all the people looked on
with fear and wonder at the dreadful sight.
</p>
<p>But at last the struggle became weaker, for
the heart was almost burned out. Then the
Stoorworm curled up and lay still, for it was
dead, and its great coils became the place
called Iceland.
</p>
<p>So was the monster killed, and that was the
manner of his death!
</p>
<p>But the King turned to Ashipattle and called
him son, and took the hand of the Princess
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
Gemlovely and laid it in the lad&#8217;s hand, for
now she was to be his bride as the King had
promised.
</p>
<p>Then they all rode back to the palace together,
and the King took the sword Snickersnapper
and gave it to Ashipattle for him to
keep as his own.
</p>
<p>A great feast was spread in honor of the
slaying of the Stoorworm. All who chose to
come were welcome, and all was mirth and
rejoicing.
</p>
<p>The honest farmer, Ashipattle&#8217;s father, and
his mother and his sister and his brothers heard
of the feast and put on their best clothes and
came, but the farmer had no Feetgong to ride.
When they entered the great hall and saw
Ashipattle sitting there at the King&#8217;s right
hand in the place of honor, with the Princess
Gemlovely beside him, they could hardly believe
their eyes, for they had not known he
was the hero every one was talking about. But
Ashipattle looked at them and nodded, and all
was well.
</p>
<p>Not long after that Ashipattle and the Princess
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
were married, and a grand wedding it was,
I can tell you; and after the old King died
Ashipattle became ruler of the whole realm,
and he and the Princess lived in mutual love
and happiness together the rest of their long
lives.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
<h2>JEAN MALIN AND THE BULL-MAN</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Louisiana Tale</span></h3>
</div>

<p>There was once a little boy who was all
alone in the world; he had no father or mother,
and no home; and no one to care for him.
That made him very sad.
</p>
<p>One day he sat by the roadside, and he was
so sad that he began to weep. Presently a fine
coach came rolling along, and in it sat a beautiful,
grand lady. She leaned back against the
cushions and looked about, first on this side
and then on that, and enjoyed herself.
</p>
<p>When she saw the little boy she made the
coachman stop.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here, little boy,&#8221; she called in a
gentle voice.
</p>
<p>The child lifted his head, and then he rose
and came over to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221; asked the lady.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jean Malin,&#8221; the child answered.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you weeping, Jean? Has some
one been unkind to you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I am weeping because I have no one
to be either unkind or kind to me. I am all
alone in the world, and I have no home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the lady heard that she felt very sorry
for him. &#8220;Come; sit here in the coach beside
me,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I will take you home with
me. My home shall be your home, and I will
keep you with me always if you are a good boy
and do as I tell you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jean Malin climbed into the coach, and the
lady took him home with her. She talked to
him and questioned him on the way, and she
soon found that he was a clever boy and very
polite in his manners.
</p>
<p>When they arrived at the lady&#8217;s house she
gave him a pretty little suit of clothes and
bade him wash and dress himself, and then
he came in and waited on her at supper.
</p>
<p>After that he lived there, and the lady became
very fond of him. As for Jean Malin,
he soon loved his mistress so dearly that if
she had been his own mother he could not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
have loved her better. Everything she said
and did seemed to him exactly right.
</p>
<p>The lady had a lover who was a great, handsome
man with a fine deep voice. This gentleman
often came to the house to take meals
with the lady, and he always spoke to Jean
Malin very pleasantly; but Jean could not
abide him. He used to run and hide whenever
this man came to the house. The lady scolded
him for it, but he could not help it.
</p>
<p>The gentleman&#8217;s name was Mr. Bulbul.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know what is the matter with
you,&#8221; said the lady to Jean Malin. &#8220;Why
is it you do not like Mr. Bulbul? He is very
kind to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know, but I wish I might never
see him again,&#8221; answered Jean.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is very wrong of you. Perhaps sometime
I may marry Mr. Bulbul. Then he will
be your master. What will you do then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I will run away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That angered the lady. &#8220;And perhaps I
will send you away if you do not behave better
and learn to like him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>Now not far from the lady&#8217;s house there was
a pasture, and in this pasture there was a bull,&mdash;a
fine, handsome animal. Jean Malin often
saw it there.
</p>
<p>After a while Jean began to notice a curious
thing. Whenever Mr. Bulbul came to the
house, which was almost every day, the bull
disappeared from the pasture, and whenever
the bull was in the pasture there was nothing
to be seen of the gentleman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a curious thing,&#8221; said Jean to
himself. &#8220;I will watch and find out what
this means. I am sure something is wrong.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So one day Jean went out and hid himself
behind some rocks at the edge of the pasture.
The bull was grazing with his head down and
did not see him. After a while the bull raised
his head and looked all about him to see if
there were any one around. He did not see
Jean, because the little boy was behind the
rocks, so the animal thought itself alone. Then
it dropped on its knees and cried, &#8220;Beau Madjam,
fat Madjam, djam, djam, djara, djara!&#8221;
</p>
<p>At once the bull became a man, and the man
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
was the very Mr. Bulbul who came to visit
Jean&#8217;s mistress.
</p>
<p>The boy was so frightened he shivered all
over as though he were cold.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bulbul walked away in the direction of
the lady&#8217;s house, and after he had gone Jean
Malin ran home by another way. He crept
into the house and heard the lady calling to
him, but he would not go to her or show himself.
She did not know what had become of
him.
</p>
<p>The next day Mr. Bulbul came again to
the lady&#8217;s house. He came very early for he
was to have breakfast with her. The lady
called Jean Malin to come and wait on them.
He did not want to come, but he was obliged
to. He was so frightened that he darted about
the room, first on one side and then on the
other, and did not understand what was said
to him. When the lady asked for water he
gave her the toast rack, and when she asked
for toast he brought her a towel. It really
was very provoking.
</p>
<p>After Mr. Bulbul had gone the lady called
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
Jean Malin to her. &#8220;I am very angry,&#8221; said
she. &#8220;You have acted very stupidly this morning.
If you cannot do better and behave in a
sensible manner, I will have to send you away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When she said this Jean Malin felt very
much hurt. He could hardly refrain from
weeping.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mistress, I will tell you why I acted so.
I was afraid, and if you knew what I know,
you would be afraid, too, and you would never
let that big man come into your house again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it that you know and I do not
know?&#8221; asked the lady.
</p>
<p>But Jean Malin would not tell her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said his mistress; &#8220;if you will
not tell me willingly I will have you beaten.
I will have you beaten until you do tell, so
you had better speak now before they begin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jean Malin began to cry. &#8220;I did not want
to tell you,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but if I must I must.
Dear Mistress, Mr. Bulbul is not a man at
all, but that bull that you sometimes see over
in the pasture. He uses magic to make himself
look like a man so as to come to see you,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
and then he goes right out and becomes a bull
again and eats grass.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lady began to laugh. &#8220;You are either
crazy or dreaming,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Or, more
likely still, you are telling me an untruth so
as to excuse yourself and make trouble between
him and me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Jean Malin insisted that what he told
her was true. &#8220;I have seen it, and I know
it,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Moreover I will prove it to
you. I do not know how, but I am sure I
can prove it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the lady, &#8220;if you prove
it I will forgive you and treat you as my
own son, but if you do not I will have you
beaten and sent out of the house as a mischief
maker.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After that Jean went away by himself and
thought and thought. He tried to remember
the exact words the bull had said when he
turned himself into a man, but he could not
be sure about them. So the next day he went
out and hid himself behind the rocks again,
taking care, as before, that the bull should not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
see him. The bull&#8217;s head was down, and it
was eating grass.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_2' id='linki_2'></a>
<img src='images/c001.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
Seeing no one, the creature dropped on its knees and<br />
bellowed, &#8220;Beau Madjam!&#8221;
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Soon, however, it raised its head and looked
all about it. Seeing no one, the creature
dropped on its knees and bellowed, &#8220;Beau
Madjam, fat Madjam, djam, djam, djara,
djara!&#8221; At once the bull became a man and
walked away in the direction of the lady&#8217;s
house.
</p>
<p>Jean Malin followed, being careful to keep
out of sight, and as he went he kept saying
over and over to himself, &#8220;Beau Madjam, fat
Madjam, djam, djam, djara, djara, Beau Madjam,
fat Madjam, djam, djam, djara, djara!&#8221;
He said it over and over, so that he should not
forget any least word of it.
</p>
<p>When Jean Malin reached home Mr. Bulbul
was in the salon with his mistress; Jean could
hear them talking together there; his mistress&#8217;s
voice very fine and clear and then Mr.
Bulbul&#8217;s big, deep voice.
</p>
<p>Jean Malin took a tray of cakes and wine
and carried it into the salon just as though his
mistress had ordered him to do so. The lady
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
was surprised to see him coming with the tray,
but she said, &#8220;That is right, Jean. Offer the
cake and wine to Mr. Bulbul.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jean Malin went over to Mr. Bulbul, close
in front of him, and then he said in a low voice,
as though to himself, &#8220;Beau Madjam, fat Madjam,
djam, djam, djara, djara!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Such a noise you never heard. The fine Mr.
Bulbul bellowed aloud and jumped up, smashing
his chair and knocking the tray with all
the plates and glasses and everything out of
Jean Malin&#8217;s hands. The lady shrieked and
almost fainted. Then, right there before her,
Mr. Bulbul&#8217;s head grew long and hairy, horns
sprouted from his forehead, his arms turned
into legs, and his hands and feet into hoofs,
and he became a bull and all his clothes fell
off him,&mdash;his trousers and coat and vest and
eyeglasses and collar and everything. He galloped
across the salon in a fright, his hoofs
clattering on the floor, and burst out through
the glass door so fast that he carried it away on
his horns and back into the pasture with him.
</p>
<p>Then the lady knew that everything Jean
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
Malin had told her was true, and she could not
thank him enough.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you shall indeed be to me as a son,&#8221;
said she, &#8220;and you shall live here always and
never leave me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jean Malin was very happy when the lady
said that to him. Nevertheless, when he
thought of Mr. Bulbul, he could not feel easy
in his mind. He was sure the bull would try
to revenge itself on him in some way or other.
He kept away from the pasture, and wherever
he went he was always looking around to see
whether the bull were anywhere in sight.
</p>
<p>At last he grew so afraid that he determined
to go and talk to a black man he knew who
dealt in magic. He found the man sitting
at the door of his hut, making magic with a
horsehair and a snakeskin, and some ground-up
glass. Jean Malin, told him everything that
had happened, about the bull, and how it had
changed itself into a man and had come to
visit the lady, and about the magic words,
and how he had forced the man to turn back
into a bull again. &#8220;And now,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
am afraid, for I think he means harm to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You do well to be afraid,&#8221; said the black
man. &#8220;Bulbul will certainly try to do you
harm. He knows much magic, but my magic
is stronger than his magic, and I will help you.
Get me three owl&#8217;s eggs and a cup of black
goat&#8217;s milk and bring them here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jean Malin went away and got the three
owl&#8217;s eggs and the cup of black goat&#8217;s milk,
though they were things not easy to find, and
then he brought them to the black man.
</p>
<p>The black man took them from him and
rolled the owl&#8217;s eggs in the milk and made
magic over them. Then he gave them back
to the boy. &#8220;Keep these by you all the time,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Then if the bull comes after you do
thus and so, and this and the other, and you
will have no more trouble with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jean Malin thanked the black man and
gave him a piece of silver, and went away
with the eggs tied up in his handkerchief.
</p>
<p>It was a good thing he had them. He had
not gone more than halfway home, and was
just coming out from a wood, when he heard a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
big noise, and the bull burst out of a thicket
and came charging down on him.
</p>
<p>But quick as a flash Jean Malin put the eggs
in his mouth and climbed up a tree, and the
eggs were not broken.
</p>
<p>The bull galloped up and struck the tree with
its horns. &#8220;You think you are safe, but I will
soon have you down,&#8221; it cried.
</p>
<p>It dropped down on its knees and muttered
magic, but Jean could not hear what it said.
Then the bull changed into a man with an
ax in his hands and began to chop down the
tree. Gip, gop! Gip, gop! The chips flew
and the branches trembled.
</p>
<p>Jean tried to remember the words that
would turn the man back into a bull again,
but he was so frightened he could not think
of them. What he did remember, though, were
the eggs the black man had given him. He
took one out of his mouth and dropped it down
on the bull-man&#8217;s right shoulder, and at once
his right arm fell off, and the ax dropped to
the ground. This did not trouble the bull-man,
however. He caught up the ax in his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
left hand and chopped away, Gip, gop! Gip,
gop! The chips flew faster than ever.
</p>
<p>Then Jean Malin dropped the second egg
down on the man&#8217;s left shoulder, and his left
arm fell off. Now he had no arms, but he
caught up the ax in his mouth and went on
chopping, Gip, gop! Gip, gop! The whole
tree shook and trembled.
</p>
<p>Then Jean Malin dropped the third and last
egg down on the man&#8217;s head, and at once his
head fell off.
</p>
<p>That ended the man&#8217;s magic; he could do
nothing more, and had to turn into a bull
again. He bellowed like anything, but he could
not help it, for the black man&#8217;s magic was
stronger than his magic. Away he galloped,
with his tail in the air, and that was the last
Jean Malin ever saw of him. What became of
him nobody ever knew, but he must have gone
far, far away.
</p>
<p>But Jean Malin climbed down from the tree
and went on home, and after that he lived
very happily in the lady&#8217;s house and was like
a son to her, just as she had promised him.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
<h2>THE WIDOW&#8217;S SON</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Scandinavian Tale</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time there was a poor widow
who had only one son, and he was so dear to
her that no one could have been dearer. All
the same she was obliged to send him out into
the world to seek his fortune, for they were so
very poor that as long as he stayed at home
they were like to starve.
</p>
<p>The lad kissed her good-by, and she gave
him her blessing, and then off he set, always
putting one foot before the other.
</p>
<p>He journeyed on a short way and a long way,
and then he came to a dark and gloomy wood.
He had not gone far into it when he met a tall
man as dark and gloomy as the wood itself.
The man stopped the lad and said to him, &#8220;Are
you seeking work or shunning work?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am seeking work,&#8221; answered the widow&#8217;s
son.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then come with me, and I will give you
enough to do but not too much,&#8221; said the
man, &#8220;and the wages will be according.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That suited the lad. He was quite willing
to work for the tall stranger. They set out
and traveled along, and after a while they came
to a great dark house set all alone in the
midst of the wood. The man showed him in
and told him what to do. The lad set to
work, and everything the man told him to do
he did so well and willingly that his master
was much pleased with him. After he had
done all the tasks set, his master gave him a
good bite of supper and a comfortable bed to
sleep in.
</p>
<p>The next day it was the same thing over.
The master told the lad what to do, and the
lad did it willingly and well. So it went on
for three days. At the end of that time the
man said, &#8220;Now I am obliged to go away on
a journey. Until I return you may do as
you please and be your own master. But
there is one part of the house you have never
seen, and those are the four cellars down below.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
Into these you must not go under any
consideration. If you so much as open one
of the doors, you will suffer for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I want to go into the cellars?&#8221;
asked the lad. &#8220;The house and the yard are
good enough for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is well,&#8221; answered the master, and
then he mounted a great black steed and rode
away.
</p>
<p>The lad stayed at home and cleaned and
polished and ate and drank. &#8220;I wonder what
can be in those cellars that my master does
not want me to see!&#8221; thought the lad. &#8220;Not
that I mean to look, but it does no harm to
wonder about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Every hour the lad stayed there in the house
alone he grew more curious about the cellars.
At last he could bear it no longer. &#8220;I&#8217;ll just
take a wee peep into one of them,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;That can surely do no harm to any one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So he opened the cellar door and went down
a flight of stone steps into the first cellar. He
looked all about him, and there was nothing at
all there but a switch made of brier lying on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
a shelf behind the door. &#8220;That is not much
for the Master to have made such a fuss about,&#8221;
said the lad. &#8220;I could see as much as that
any day without coming into a cellar for it;&#8221;
and he went upstairs again and shut the door
behind him.
</p>
<p>The next day the master came home, and
the first thing he asked was, &#8220;Have you looked
into any of the cellars?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I do that?&#8221; asked the lad.
&#8220;I have plenty to do upstairs without poking
my nose in where it is not wanted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will just see for myself whether or not
you have looked,&#8221; said the master.
</p>
<p>He opened one of the doors and went down
into the first cellar. When he came back his
face was as black as thunder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have disobeyed me and have gone into
one of the cellars,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Now you shall
suffer for it!&#8221; He took up a cudgel and beat
the lad until he was black and blue. &#8220;It&#8217;s
lucky for you you went only into the first
cellar,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Otherwise you would not
have come off so lightly.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>Then he sat down to supper.
</p>
<p>As for the lad he sat and nursed his bruises
and wished he had never heard tell of such a
thing as a cellar.
</p>
<p>Not long after the master said he was going
on another journey. &#8220;I will be gone two
weeks,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and whatever you do, do
not dare to look into any of the other cellars,
or you will suffer for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have learned my lesson,&#8221; said the lad.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll not find me doing such a thing again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After that the master mounted his horse and
rode away.
</p>
<p>After he had gone the lad cleaned and polished
and ate and drank, and then he began to wonder
what was in the second cellar. &#8220;There
must be something more than a stick to see,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;or my master would not be so particular
about it.&#8221; In the end he determined
to look at what was in the second cellar, whatever
it cost him. He opened the door and
went down the stone steps that led to it and
looked about, but all he saw was a shelf behind
the door, and on it a stone and a water bottle.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They are not much to see, and I wish I
had not come,&#8221; said the lad to himself. &#8220;I
hope my master will not know about it;&#8221;
and then he went upstairs and shut the door
behind him.
</p>
<p>Not long afterward his master came home.
The first thing he asked was, &#8220;Have you been
down in any of the cellars again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you think such a thing!&#8221; cried
the lad. &#8220;I have no wish for another beating.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All the same, I will see for myself,&#8221; said
the master, and he went down into the second
cellar. Then the lad was frightened, you may
well believe.
</p>
<p>When the Master came back his face was as
red as fire. &#8220;You have disobeyed me again,&#8221;
cried he. Then he seized a cudgel and beat
the lad till he could hardly stand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This should teach you to obey,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;but I fear as long as you live you will not
learn.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Not long after the Master was going away
on a third journey, and this time he was to be
away for three weeks. &#8220;And if you look in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
the third cellar,&#8221; said he, &#8220;your life shall pay
the forfeit.&#8221; After that he rode away into the
forest and out of sight.
</p>
<p>Well, for two weeks the lad would not look
into the third cellar, but at last his curiosity
got the better of him. He opened the third
door and went down into the third cellar.
There in the middle of it was a brazen caldron
set deep in the floor and full of something that
seethed and bubbled. &#8220;I wonder what that
is in the caldron,&#8221; said the lad to himself, and
he stuck his finger in. When he drew it out
it was covered all over with gold. The lad
scrubbed and scrubbed, but he could not get
the gold off. Then he was terribly frightened.
He took a rag and wound it about his finger
and hoped his master would not notice it. He
shut the door into the cellar and tried to forget
about it.
</p>
<p>The first thing the Master asked when he
came home was, &#8220;Have you been down in the
third cellar?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you think it?&#8221; asked the lad.
&#8220;Two drubbings are enough for any one.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter with your finger?&#8221;
asked the Master.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I cut it with the bread-knife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Master snatched the rag off, and there
the lad&#8217;s finger shone as though it were all of
solid gold.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been down in the third cellar,&#8221;
cried the Master, &#8220;and now you must die,&#8221;&mdash;and
his face was as pale as death. He took
down a sword from the wall, but the lad fell
on his knees and begged and pleaded so piteously
for his life that at last the man had to spare him.
All the same he gave him such a beating that the
lad could not rise from the floor. There he lay
and groaned. Then the Master took a flask of
ointment from the wall and bathed him all over,
and after that the lad was just as well as ever.
</p>
<p>Now the Master stayed at home for a long
while, but at last he had to go away on still
another journey, and now he was to be gone a
whole month. &#8220;And if you dare to look in
the fourth cellar while I am away, then you
shall surely die,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Do not hope that
I will spare you again, for I will not.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>After he had gone the lad resisted his curiosity
for three whole weeks. He was dying to look
in the fourth cellar and see what was there,
but he dared not, for dear life&#8217;s sake. But at
the end of the third week he was so curious
that he could resist no longer. He opened the
fourth door and went down the steps into the
cellar, and there was a magnificent coal-black
horse chained to a manger, and the manger
was filled with red-hot coals. At the horse&#8217;s
tail was a basket of hay.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a cruel thing to do to an animal,&#8221;
cried the lad, and he loosed the horse from the
manger and turned him so he could eat.
</p>
<p>Then the black steed spoke to him in a human
tone. &#8220;You have done a Christian act,&#8221; said
the horse, &#8220;and you shall not suffer for it. If
the Troll Master finds you here when he returns
he will surely take your life, and that
must not be. Look over in yonder corner,
and you will find a suit of armor and a sword.
Put on the armor and take up the sword in
your hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lad went over to the corner, and there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
lay the armor and the sword, but when he
would have taken them up they were too heavy
for him. He could scarce stir them. &#8220;Well,
there is no help for it,&#8221; said the horse. &#8220;You
will have to bathe in the caldron that is in the
third cellar. Only so can you take up the
armor and wear it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This the lad did not want to do, for he was
afraid. &#8220;If you do not,&#8221; said the horse, &#8220;we
will both of us lose our lives.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the lad went back to the third cellar
and shut his eyes and stepped down into the
caldron, and though the waters in it bubbled
and seethed they were as cold as ice and as
bitter as death. He thought he would have
died of cold, but presently he grew quite warm
again. He stepped out from the caldron, and
he had become the handsomest lad in the world;
his skin was red and white, and his eyes shone
like stars. He went back to where the horse
was, and now he lifted the armor with ease, he
had become so strong. He put it on and
buckled the sword about him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we must be off,&#8221; cried the horse.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
&#8220;Take the briar whip and the stone and the
jug of water and the flask of ointment. Then
mount my back and ride. If the Troll Master
finds us here when he returns, it will be short
shrift for both of us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lad did as the horse bade him; he took
the briar whip and the stone, the jug of water
and the flask of ointment, and mounted the
black steed&#8217;s back; and the steed carried him
up the steps and out of the house and fast,
fast away through the forest and over the
plains beyond.
</p>
<p>After a while the black horse said, &#8220;I hear
a noise behind us. Look and see whether any
one is coming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lad turned and looked. &#8220;Yes, yes; it
is the Master,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and with him is a
whole crowd of people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are his friends he has brought out
against us,&#8221; said the steed. &#8220;If they catch
us it will go ill with us. Throw the thorn
whip behind us, but be sure you throw it clear
and do not let it touch even the tip of my tail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lad threw the whip behind him, and at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
once a great forest of thorns grew up where
it fell. No one could have forced a way through
it. The Master and his friends were obliged
to go home and get hatchets and axes and cut a
path through.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the black horse had gone a long
way. Then he said, &#8220;Look behind you, for I
hear a noise; is any one coming?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The youth looked over his shoulder. &#8220;Yes,
it is the Master,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and with him are
a multitude of people&mdash;like a church congregation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still more of his friends have come to help
him catch us,&#8221; said the horse. &#8220;Throw the
stone behind us, but be very sure it does not
touch me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lad threw the stone behind him, and at
once a great stone mountain rose up where it
fell. The Master and his friends could by no
means cross over it. They were obliged to
go home and get something to bore a way
through, and this they did.
</p>
<p>But by this time the horse had gone a long,
long way. Then he said to the lad, &#8220;Look
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
back and see whether you see any one, for I
hear a noise behind us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lad looked back. &#8220;I see the Master
coming,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and a great multitude with
him, so that they are like an army for numbers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said the horse. &#8220;He has all of
his friends with him now. Woe betide us if
they catch us. Pour the water from the jug
behind us, but be careful that none of it touches
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lad stretched back his arm and poured
the water out from the jug, but his haste was
such that three drops fell upon the horse&#8217;s
flanks. Immediately a great lake rose about
them, and because of the three drops that had
fallen on the horse, the lake was not only behind
them but about them, too; the steed had
to swim for it.
</p>
<p>The Trolls came to the edge of the lake, and
as there was no way to cross over they threw
themselves down on their stomachs and began
to drink it up. They drank and they drank
and they drank, until at last they all burst.
</p>
<p>But the steed came out from the water and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
up on dry land. Then he went on until he
came to a wood, and here he stopped. &#8220;Light
down now,&#8221; said he to the lad, &#8220;and take off
your armor and my saddle and bridle and hide
them in yon hollow oak tree. Over there, a
little beyond, is a castle, and you must go and
take service there. But first make yourself a
wig of hanging gray mosses and put it on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lad did as the horse told him. He took
off the saddle and bridle and the armor and
hid them in the tree, and made for himself a
moss wig; when he put it upon his head all
the beauty went out of his face, and he looked
so pale and miserable that no one would have
wanted him around.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you ever need me,&#8221; said the horse, &#8220;come
here to the wood and take out the bridle and
shake it, and at once I will be with you.&#8221; Then
he galloped away into the wood.
</p>
<p>The lad in his moss wig went on until he
came to the castle. He went to the kitchen
door and knocked, and asked if he might take
service there.
</p>
<p>The kitchen wench looked at him and made
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
a face as though she had a sour taste in her
mouth. &#8220;Take off that wig and let me see
how you look,&#8221; said she. &#8220;With that on your
head you are so ugly that no one would want
you around.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot take off my wig,&#8221; said the lad,
&#8220;for that I have been told not to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you may seek service elsewhere, for
I cannot bear the look of you,&#8221; said the kitchen
wench, and she shut the door in his face.
</p>
<p>Next the lad went to the gardener and
asked if he could help him in the gardens,
digging and planting.
</p>
<p>The gardener looked and stared. &#8220;You are
not a beauty,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but out here in the
garden no one will be apt to see you, and I
need a helper, so you may stay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So the lad became the gardener&#8217;s helper and
dug and hoed in the garden all day.
</p>
<p>Now the King and Queen of that country
had one fair daughter, and she was as pretty
and as fresh as a rose.
</p>
<p>One day the gardener set the lad to spading
under the Princess&#8217;s window. She looked out,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
and there she saw him. &#8220;Br-r-r! But he is
an ugly one,&#8221; said she. Nevertheless she
couldn&#8217;t keep her eyes off him.
</p>
<p>After a while the lad grew hot with his work.
He looked about him, and he saw nobody, so
he whipped off his wig to wipe his forehead,
and then he was as handsome a lad as ever
was seen, so that the Princess&#8217;s heart turned
right over at the sight of him. Then he put
on his wig and became ugly again, and went
on spading, but now the Princess knew what
he was really like.
</p>
<p>The next day there was the lad at work under
her window again, but as he had his wig on he
was just as ugly as before. Then the Princess
said to her maid, &#8220;Go down there where the
gardener&#8217;s lad is working and creep up behind
him and twitch his wig off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The maid went down to the garden and crept
up back of the lad and gave the wig a twitch,
but he was too clever for her. He heard her
coming, and he held the wig tight down over
his ears. All the same the Princess had once
seen what he was like without it, and she made
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
up her mind that if she could not have the gardener&#8217;s
lad for a husband she would never marry
any one.
</p>
<p>Now after this there was a great war and disturbance
in the land. The King&#8217;s enemies had
risen up against him and had come to take away
his land from him. But the King with his
courtiers and his armed men rode out to meet
them and turn them back. The lad would
have liked to ride with them and strike a blow
for the King, but the gardener would not hear
of it. Nevertheless the day the King and his
army were ready to set out the lad stole away
to the stables and begged the stablemen to
give him a mount.
</p>
<p>It seemed to the men that that would be a
merry thing to do. He was such a scarecrow
they gave him a scarecrow horse. It was old
and blind of one eye and limped on three legs,
dragging the fourth behind it. The lad mounted
and rode forth with all the rest, and when the
courtiers saw him they laughed and laughed
until their sides ached.
</p>
<p>They had not gone far before they had to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
cross a swamp, and midway through it the
nag stuck fast. There sat the lad, beating it
and shouting, &#8220;Hie! Hie! Now will you go?
Hie! Hie! Now will you go?&#8221; Every one
went riding by, and as they passed him they
pointed and laughed and jeered.
</p>
<p>After they had all gone the lad slipped from
the nag&#8217;s back and ran off to the wood. He
snatched off his wig and took his armor from
the hollow tree and shook the bridle. At once
the black steed came galloping up. The lad
mounted him and rode off after the others.
His armor shone in the sun, and so handsome
was he, and so noble his air that any one would
have taken him for a prince at least.
</p>
<p>When he reached the battle ground he found
the King sore pressed, but he rode so fiercely
against the enemy that they were obliged to
fall back, and the King&#8217;s own forces won the
day. Then the lad rode away so quickly that
no one knew what had become of him. The
King was sorry, for he wished to thank the
brave hero who had fought for him.
</p>
<p>But the lad rode back to the wood and hid
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
his armor in a tree and turned the black steed
loose. Then he put on his wig and ran back
and mounted the sorry nag that was still stuck
in the swamp where he had left it.
</p>
<p>When the King and his courtiers came riding
back there sat the lad in rags and a gray moss
wig, and he was beating his horse and shouting,
&#8220;Hie! Hie! Now will you go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the courtiers laughed more than ever,
and one of them threw a clod at him.
</p>
<p>The next day the King again rode forth to
war with all his train. There was the lad still
seated on the nag in the swamp. &#8220;What a
fool he is,&#8221; they cried. &#8220;He must have been
sitting there all night.&#8221; Then they rode on
and left him.
</p>
<p>But the lad ran with haste to the wood and
took his armor from the tree and put it on.
He shook the bridle, and the black steed came
galloping up to him. The lad mounted and
rode away to the battle field. The King&#8217;s
forces were falling back, but the lad attacked
the enemy so fiercely that they were put to
rout. Every one wondered who the hero could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
be, but as soon as the battle was won he rode
away so swiftly that no one had a chance to
question him and no one knew what had become
of him. &#8220;If I could but find him,&#8221; said the
King, &#8220;I would honor him as I have never
honored any one, for such a hero never was
seen before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the lad hastened back to the wood; he
laid aside his armor and turned the black steed
loose. Then he put on his wig again and ran
back to the swamp and mounted the sorry
nag.
</p>
<p>When the King&#8217;s forces came riding home,
there sat the gardener&#8217;s ugly lad, whipping his
sorry nag and crying &#8220;Hie! Hie! Now will
you go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The courtiers looked upon him with scorn.
&#8220;Why does he not go home and get to work?&#8221;
they cried. &#8220;Such a scarecrow is an insult to
all who see him.&#8221; One of the courtiers, more
ill-natured than the rest, shot an arrow at him,
and it pierced his leg so the blood flowed. The
lad cried out so that it was pitiful to hear him.
The King felt sorry for him, ugly though he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
was, and drew out his own royal handkerchief
and threw it to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, Sirrah! Take that and bind up thy
wound!&#8221; he cried.
</p>
<p>The lad took the handkerchief and bound it
about his leg, and so the bleeding was stopped.
</p>
<p>The next day, when the courtiers rode by,
there sat the lad still upon his broken-down
nag, shouting to it as if to urge it forward, and
his leg was tied up with the bloody kerchief,
and the King&#8217;s own initials were on the kerchief
in letters of gold.
</p>
<p>The courtiers did not dare to jeer at him this
time, because the King had been kind to him,
but they turned their faces aside so as not to
see him.
</p>
<p>As soon as they had gone the lad sprang down
and ran to the wood and put on his armor and
shook the bridle for the black steed, but he
was in such haste, that he forgot the kerchief
that he had used to bind up his wound, and so,
when he rode out upon the battle field, he had
it still tied about his leg.
</p>
<p>That day the lad fought more fiercely than
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
ever before, and it was well he did, for otherwise
the King&#8217;s forces would certainly have
been defeated. Already they were in retreat
when the lad rode forth upon the field. But at
sight of him they took heart again, and he
led them on and did not stop or stay till he
came to where the enemy&#8217;s leader was, and
with one blow of his sword cut off his head.
</p>
<p>Then all the enemy&#8217;s forces fled back, and
the King&#8217;s men pursued after them and cut
many of them to pieces, and the rest were glad
to get safely back into their own country.
</p>
<p>After that the lad would have ridden away
as before, but this the King would not allow.
He called to him and rode up to where he was,
and when he saw the bloody kerchief tied about
the stranger&#8217;s leg he knew he must be the very
one he had left sitting on the old nag in the
swamp awhile back.
</p>
<p>This the lad could not deny, and when the
King questioned him he told him everything.
</p>
<p>Then the King said, &#8220;Though you are only
a gardener&#8217;s lad still you are a mighty hero,
and the hand of the Princess shall be yours.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
You shall marry her, and after I die you shall
rule over the kingdom in my stead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>You may guess the lad did not say no to
that, for he had seen the Princess sitting at
her window, and just from looking at her there
he loved her with all his heart.
</p>
<p>So the King and the courtiers rode home with
the lad in their midst, and when the Princess
heard she was to marry him she was filled with
joy, for she recognized him at once as the
gardener&#8217;s boy who had worked beneath her
window.
</p>
<p>Then all was joy and happiness. A great
feast was prepared, and the lad and the Princess
were married with the greatest magnificence.
But first the lad rubbed his leg with the ointment
and then it became quite well again; for
it would never have done for him to go limping
to his own wedding.
</p>
<p>Now as soon as he was married he went out
to the stable to tell it to the black steed. He
found the horse sad and sorrowful. It stood
drooping and would not raise its head or speak
when he entered the stall.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>The lad was troubled at this. &#8220;What
ails you, my steed, that you stand there
so sorrowful when all around rejoice?&#8221; asked
he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sick at heart,&#8221; answered the steed,
&#8220;and you alone can cure me of my sickness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How is that?&#8221; asked the lad.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Promise to do whatsoever I ask of you,
and I will tell you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise,&#8221; replied the lad, &#8220;for there is
nothing I would not do for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then take your sword and cut off my
head,&#8221; said the steed.
</p>
<p>When the lad heard this he was horrified.
&#8220;What is this you ask of me?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;All
that I have I owe to you, and shall I in return
do you such an injury?&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the black horse reminded him that he
had promised. &#8220;If you do not do as I ask
you,&#8221; said he, &#8220;then I shall know that you are
a coward who dares not keep his word.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The youth could not refuse after that. He
was obliged to do as the horse bade him, but
the tears dimmed his eyes so that he could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
scarcely see. He drew his sword and cut off
the horse&#8217;s head. At once, instead of a coal-black
steed, a handsome young Prince stood
before him. The lad could scarce believe his
eyes. He stared about him, wondering what
had become of the horse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no need to look for the black steed,&#8221;
said the princely stranger, &#8220;for I am he.&#8221; He
then told the lad that he was the son of the
King of a neighboring country. An enemy
had risen up and slain the King and had
given the Prince to the black master who had
turned him into a horse and taken him away
to his castle. &#8220;You have rescued me from the
enchantment, and now I am free to claim
my land again,&#8221; said the Prince. He then
told the lad that the enemy King whom he
had lately slain in battle was the very one
who had taken his kingdom from him.
</p>
<p>Then the Prince went back with the lad
to the palace, and was introduced to the King
and the Princess and all the court.
</p>
<p>After that the lad and his bride and the
Prince rode forth with a great retinue into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
the Prince&#8217;s own country, and his people received
him with joy, and he and the lad lived
in the greatest love and friendship forever
after.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
<h2>THE WISE GIRL</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Serbian Story</span></h3>
</div>

<p>There was once a girl who was wiser than
the King and all his councilors; there never
was anything like it. Her father was so proud
of her that he boasted about her cleverness
at home and abroad. He could not keep his
tongue still about it. One day he was boasting
to one of his neighbors, and he said, &#8220;The
girl is so clever that not even the King himself
could ask her a question she couldn&#8217;t answer,
or read her a riddle she couldn&#8217;t unravel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Now it so chanced the King was sitting at a
window near by, and he overheard what the
girl&#8217;s father was saying. The next day he
sent for the man to come before him. &#8220;I
hear you have a daughter who is so clever
that no one in the kingdom can equal her;
and is that so?&#8221; asked the King.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>Yes, it was no more than the truth. Too
much could not be said of her wit and cleverness.
</p>
<p>That was well, and the King was glad to
hear it. He had thirty eggs; they were fresh
and good, but it would take a clever person
to hatch chickens out of them. He then bade
his chancellor get the eggs and give them to
the man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take these home to your daughter,&#8221; said
the King, &#8220;and bid her hatch them out for
me. If she succeeds she shall have a bag of
money for her pains, but if she fails you shall
be beaten as a vain boaster.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man was troubled when he heard this.
Still his daughter was so clever he was almost
sure she could hatch out the eggs. He carried
them home to her and told her exactly what
the King had said, and it did not take the girl
long to find out that the eggs had been boiled.
</p>
<p>When she told her father that, he made a
great to-do. That was a pretty trick for the
King to have played upon him. Now he
would have to take a beating and all the neighbors
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
would hear about it. Would to Heaven
he had never had a daughter at all if that was
what came of it.
</p>
<p>The girl, however, bade him be of good
cheer. &#8220;Go to bed and sleep quietly,&#8221; said
she. &#8220;I will think of some way out of the
trouble. No harm shall come to you, even
though I have to go to the palace myself and
take the beating in your place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next day the girl gave her father a bag
of boiled beans and bade him take them out
to a certain place where the King rode by
every day. &#8220;Wait until you see him coming,&#8221;
said she, &#8220;and then begin to sow the beans.&#8221;
At the same time he was to call out this, that,
and the other so loudly that the King could
not help but hear him.
</p>
<p>The man took the bag of beans and went
out to the field his daughter had spoken of.
He waited until he saw the King coming, and
then he began to sow the beans, and at the
same time to cry aloud, &#8220;Come sun, come
rain! Heaven grant that these boiled beans
may yield me a good crop.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>The King was surprised that any one should
be so stupid as to think boiled beans would
grow and yield a crop. He did not recognize
the man, for he had only seen him once, and
he stopped his horse to speak to him. &#8220;My
poor man,&#8221; said he, &#8220;how can you expect
boiled beans to grow? Do you not know
that that is impossible?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever the King commands should be
possible,&#8221; answered the man, &#8220;and if chickens
can hatch from boiled eggs why should not
boiled beans yield a crop?&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the King heard this he looked at the
man more closely, and then he recognized him
as the father of the clever daughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have indeed a clever daughter,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;Take your beans home and bring me
back the eggs I gave you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man was very glad when he heard that,
and made haste to obey. He carried the beans
home and then took the eggs and brought them
back to the palace of the King.
</p>
<p>After the King had received the eggs he gave
the man a handful of flax. &#8220;Take this to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
your clever daughter,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and bid her
make for me within the week a full set of sails
for a large ship. If she does this she shall
receive the half of my kingdom as a reward,
but if she fails you shall have a drubbing that
you will not soon forget.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man returned to his home, loudly lamenting
his hard lot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; asked his daughter.
&#8220;Has the King set another task that I must do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Yes, that he had; and her father showed
her the flax the King had sent her and gave
her the message.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not be troubled,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;No
harm shall come to you. Go to bed and sleep
quietly, and to-morrow I will send the King an
answer that will satisfy him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man believed what his daughter said.
He went to bed and slept quietly.
</p>
<p>The next day the girl gave her father a small
piece of wood. &#8220;Carry this to the King,&#8221; said
she. &#8220;Tell him I am ready to make the sails,
but first let him make me of this wood a large
ship that I may fit the sails to it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>The father did as the girl bade him, and the
King was surprised at the cleverness of the girl
in returning him such an answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is all very well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and I will
excuse her from this task. But here! Here
is a glass mug. Take it home to your clever
daughter. Tell her it is my command that she
dip out the waters from the ocean bed so that
I can ride over the bottom dry shod. If she does
this, I will take her for my wife, but if she fails
you shall be beaten within an inch of your life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man took the mug and hastened home,
weeping aloud and bemoaning his fate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, and what is it?&#8221; asked his daughter.
&#8220;What does the King demand of me now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man gave her the glass mug and told
her what the King had said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not be troubled,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;Go
to bed and sleep in peace. You shall not be
beaten, and soon I shall be reigning as Queen
over all this land.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man had trust in her. He went to bed
and slept and dreamed he saw her sitting by
the King with a crown on her head.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>The next day the girl gave her father a bunch
of tow. &#8220;Take this to the King,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Tell him you have given me the mug, and I
am willing to dip the sea dry, but first let him
take this tow and stop up all the rivers that
flow into the ocean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man did as his daughter bade him. He
took the tow to the King and told him exactly
what the girl had said.
</p>
<p>Then the King saw that the girl was indeed
a clever one, and he sent for her to come before
him.
</p>
<p>She came just as she was, in her homespun
dress and her rough shoes and with a cap on
her head, but for all her mean clothing she
was as pretty and fine as a flower, and the
King was not slow to see it. Still he wanted
to make sure for himself that she was as clever
as her messages had been.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; said he, &#8220;what sound can be
heard the farthest throughout the world?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The thunder that echoes through heaven
and earth,&#8221; answered the girl, &#8220;and your own
royal commands that go from lip to lip.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>This reply pleased the King greatly. &#8220;And
now tell me,&#8221; said he, &#8220;exactly what is my
royal sceptre worth?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is worth exactly as much as the power
for which it stands,&#8221; the girl replied.
</p>
<p>The King was so well satisfied with the
way the girl answered that he no longer
hesitated; he determined that she should be
his Queen, and that they should be married
at once.
</p>
<p>The girl had something to say to this, however.
&#8220;I am but a poor girl,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and
my ways are not your ways. It may well be
that you will tire of me, or that you may be
angry with me sometime, and send me back
to my father&#8217;s house to live. Promise that if
this should happen you will allow me to carry
back with me from the castle the thing that
has grown most precious to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The King was willing to agree to this, but
the girl was not satisfied until he had written
down his promise and signed it with his own
royal hand. Then she and the King were
married with the greatest magnificence, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
she came to live in the palace and reign over
the land.
</p>
<p>Now while the girl was still only a peasant
she had been well content to dress in homespun
and live as a peasant should, but after she became
Queen she would wear nothing but the
most magnificent robes and jewels and ornaments,
for that seemed to her only right and
proper for a Queen. But the King, who was
of a very jealous nature, thought his wife did
not care at all for him, but only for the fine
things he could give her.
</p>
<p>One time the King and Queen were to ride
abroad together, and the Queen spent so much
time in dressing herself that the King was kept
waiting, and he became very angry. When
she appeared before him, he would not even
look at her. &#8220;You care nothing for me, but
only for the jewels and fine clothes you wear,&#8221;
he cried. &#8220;Take with you those that are the
most precious to you, as I promised you, and
return to your father&#8217;s house. I will no longer
have a wife who cares only for my possessions
and not at all for me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>Very well; the girl was willing to go. &#8220;And
I will be happier in my father&#8217;s house than I
was when I first met you,&#8221; said she. Nevertheless
she begged that she might spend one
more night in the palace, and that she and
the King might sup together once again before
she returned home.
</p>
<p>To this the King agreed, for he still loved
her, even though he was so angry with her.
</p>
<p>So he and his wife supped together that evening,
and just at the last the Queen took a golden
cup and filled it with wine. Then, when the
King was not looking, she put a sleeping potion
in the wine and gave it to him to drink.
</p>
<p>He took it and drank to the very last drop,
suspecting nothing, but soon after he sank
down among the cushions in a deep sleep.
Then the Queen caused him to be carried to
her father&#8217;s house and laid in the bed there.
</p>
<p>When the King awoke the next morning he
was very much surprised to find himself in the
peasant&#8217;s cottage. He raised himself upon his
elbow to look about him, and at once the girl
came to the bedside, and she was again dressed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
in the coarse and common clothes she had worn
before she was married.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What means this?&#8221; asked the King, &#8220;and
how came I here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear husband,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;your
promise was that if you ever sent me back
to my father&#8217;s house I might carry with me
the thing that had become most precious to
me in the castle. You are that most precious
thing, and I care for nothing else except as
it makes me pleasing in your sight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the King could no longer feel jealous
or angry with her. He clasped her in his
arms, and they kissed each other tenderly.
That same day they returned to the palace,
and from that time on the King and his peasant
Queen lived together in the greatest love and
happiness.

<h2>THE HISTORY OF ALI COGIA</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>From the Arabian Nights</span></h3>
</div>

<p>In the city of Bagdad there once lived a merchant
named Ali Cogia. This merchant was
faithful and honest in all his dealings, but he
had never made the holy pilgrimage to Mecca.
He often felt troubled over this, for he knew
he was neglecting a religious duty, but he was
so occupied with his business affairs that it was
difficult for him to leave home. Year after year
he planned to make the pilgrimage, but always
he postponed it, hoping for some more convenient
time.
</p>
<p>One night the merchant had a dream so vivid
that it was more like a vision than a dream.
In this dream or vision an old man appeared
before him and, regarding him with a severe
and reproachful look, said, &#8220;Why have you not
made the pilgrimage to Mecca?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>When Ali Cogia awoke he felt greatly
troubled. He feared this dream had been sent
him as a reproach and a warning from heaven.
He was still more troubled when the next night
he dreamed the same dream; and when upon
the third night the old man again appeared before
him and asked the same question, he determined
to delay no longer, but to set out upon
the pilgrimage as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>To this end he sold off all his goods except
some that he decided to carry with him to
Mecca and to dispose of there. He settled
all his debts and rented his shop and his
house to a friend, and as he had neither wife
nor family, he was now free to set out at
any time.
</p>
<p>The sale of his goods had brought in quite a
large sum of money, so that after he had set
aside as much as was needed for the journey
he found he had still a thousand gold pieces
left over.
</p>
<p>These he determined to leave in some safe
place until his return. He put the money in
an olive jar and covered it over with olives and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
sealed it carefully. He then carried the jar to
a friend named Abul Hassan, who was the owner
of a large warehouse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Abul Hassan,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I am about to
make the journey to Mecca, as you perhaps
know. I have here a jar of olives that I would
like to leave in your warehouse until my return,
if you will allow me to do so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Abul Hassan was quite willing that his friend
should do this and gave him the keys of the
warehouse, bidding him place the jar wherever
he wished. &#8220;I will gladly keep it until
you return,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and you may rest
assured the jar will not be disturbed until such
time as you shall come and claim it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ali Cogia thanked his friend and carried the
jar into the warehouse, placing it in the farthest
and darkest corner where it would not be in the
way. Soon after he set out upon his journey
to Mecca.
</p>
<p>When Ali Cogia left Bagdad he had no
thought but that he would return in a year&#8217;s
time at latest. He made the journey safely,
in company with a number of other pilgrims.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
Arrived in Mecca, he visited the celebrated
temples and other objects of interest that were
there. He performed all his religious duties
faithfully, and after that he went to the bazaar
and secured a place where he could display the
goods he had brought with him.
</p>
<p>One day a stranger came through the bazaar
and stopped to admire the beauty of the things
Ali had for sale.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a pity,&#8221; said the stranger, &#8220;that you
should not go to Cairo. You could go there
at no great expense, and I feel assured that you
would receive a far better price for your goods
there than here. I know, for I have lived in
that city all my life, and I am familiar with the
prices that are paid for such fine merchandise
as yours.&#8221; The stranger talked with Ali for
some time and then passed on his way.
</p>
<p>After he had gone the merchant meditated
upon what had been said, and he finally determined
to follow the stranger&#8217;s advice and to
take such goods as he had left to Cairo, and
place them on sale there. This he did and
found that, as the stranger had promised, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
prices he could get there were much higher than
those paid in Mecca.
</p>
<p>While Ali Cogia was in Cairo he made the
acquaintance of some people who were about to
journey down into Egypt by caravan. They
urged Ali to join them, and after some persuasion
he consented to do so, as he had always
wished to see that country. From Egypt Ali
Cogia journeyed to Constantinople, and then
on to other cities and countries. Time flew by
so rapidly that when, finally, Ali stopped to
reckon up how long it was since he had left
Bagdad, he found that seven years had elapsed.
</p>
<p>He now determined to return without delay
to his own city. He found a camel that suited
him, and having bought it he packed upon it
such goods as he had left, and set out for Bagdad.
</p>
<p>Now all the while that Ali Cogia had been
travelling from place to place the jar containing
the gold pieces had rested undisturbed and
forgotten in Abul Hassan&#8217;s warehouse. Abul
and his wife sometimes talked of Ali and wondered
when he would return and how he had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
fared upon his journey. They were surprised
at his long absence and feared some misfortune
might have come upon him. At one time
there was a rumor that he was dead, but
this rumor was afterward denied.
</p>
<p>Now the very day that Ali Cogia set out
upon his return journey Abul Hassan and his
wife were seated at the table at their evening
meal, and their talk turned upon the subject of
olives.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a long time since we have had any in
the house,&#8221; said the wife. &#8220;Indeed, I do not
remember when I last tasted one, and yet
it is my favorite fruit. I wish we had some
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we must get some,&#8221; said Abul Hassan.
&#8220;And by the way, that reminds me of the jar
that Ali Cogia left with us. I wonder whether
the olives in it are still good. They have been
there for some years now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, for seven years,&#8221; replied his wife. &#8220;No
doubt they are all spoiled by this time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That I will see,&#8221; said Abul Hassan, rising
and taking up a light. &#8220;If they are still good
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
we might as well have some, for I do not believe
Ali Cogia will ever return to claim the jar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His wife was horrified. &#8220;What are you
thinking of?&#8221; cried she. &#8220;Ali Cogia entrusted
this jar to you, and you gave your word that it
would not be disturbed until he came again to
claim it. We heard, indeed, that he was dead,
but this rumor was afterward denied. What
opinion would he have of you if he returned
and found you had helped yourself to his olives?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Abul Hassan, still holding the light in his
hand, waited impatiently until his wife had
finished speaking. Then he replied, &#8220;Ali Cogia
will not return; of that I feel assured. And at
any rate, if he should, I can easily replace the
olives.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can replace the olives, no doubt,&#8221; answered
his wife, &#8220;but they would not be Ali
Cogia&#8217;s olives. This jar is a sacred trust and
should not be disturbed by you under any
consideration.&#8221; But though she spoke thus
strongly she could see by her husband&#8217;s face
that he had not changed his determination.
He now took up the dish and said, &#8220;If the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
olives are good I will bring a dish full from the
jar, but if they are spoiled, as I suppose they are,
I will replace the cover and no one will be any
the wiser.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His wife would have tried again to dissuade
him, but without listening further he went at
once to the warehouse. It did not take him
long to find the jar. He took off the cover and
found that, as he had suspected, the olives were
spoiled. Wishing to see whether those beneath
were in the same condition he tilted the jar
and emptied some of them out into the dish.
What was his surprise to see some gold pieces
fall out with the olives. Abul Hassan could
hardly believe his eyes. Hastily he plunged his
hands down into the jar and soon found that
except for the top layer of fruit the whole jar
was full of gold pieces.
</p>
<p>Abul Hassan&#8217;s eyes sparkled with desire. He
was naturally a very avaricious man, and the
sight of the gold awakened all his greed. It
had been there in his warehouse, all unknown
to him, for seven years. He felt as though he
had been tricked, for, thought he, &#8220;All this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
time I might have been using this money to
advantage by trading with it and with no harm
to any one, for I could have replaced it at any
time I heard Ali Cogia was about to return.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a while he stood there lost in thought.
Then he returned the gold to the jar, covered it
over with olives as before, and replaced the
cover, and taking up the empty dish and the
light he returned to his wife.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were quite right,&#8221; said he carelessly.
&#8220;The olives were spoiled, so I did not bring
any.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You should not even have opened the jar,&#8221;
said his wife. &#8220;Heaven grant that no evil
may come upon us for this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>To this remark Abul Hassan made no reply,
and soon after he and his wife retired to rest.
But the merchant could not sleep. All night he
tossed and twisted, thinking of the gold and
planning how he could make it his own, and it
was not until morning that he fell into a troubled
sleep.
</p>
<p>The next day he arose early and as soon as
the bazaar opened he went out and bought a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
quantity of olives. He brought them home and
carried them into the warehouse secretly, and
without his wife&#8217;s knowing anything about it.
Then he again opened Ali Cogia&#8217;s jar, and having
emptied it of its contents, he filled it with fresh
olives and replaced the cover in such a way
that no one, looking at it, would have known
it had been disturbed. He then threw the
spoiled olives away and hid the gold in a secret
place known only to himself.
</p>
<p>About a month after this Ali Cogia returned
to Bagdad. As his own house was still rented
he took a room in a khan and at once hastened
to Abul Hassan&#8217;s house to get his jar.
</p>
<p>Abul Hassan was confounded when he saw Ali
Cogia enter his house, for he had managed to
convince himself that Ali must be dead. This
he had done to try to excuse himself in his own eyes
for taking the gold. However he hid his confusion
as best he could, and made the returned
traveller welcome, and asked him how he had
fared in his journeyings.
</p>
<p>Ali Cogia answered his inquiries politely,
but he was uneasy and restless, and as soon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
as he could make the opportunity he inquired
about the olive jar he had left in the warehouse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The jar is there where you put it, I am
sure,&#8221; answered Abul Hassan, &#8220;though I myself
have not seen it. I do not even know in what
part of the warehouse you left it. But here
are the keys, and as I am busy I will ask you
to get it for yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ali Cogia made haste to seek out the jar
and was much relieved to find it exactly where
he had left it and apparently untouched. He
had trust in Abul Hassan&#8217;s honor, but a thousand
pieces of gold was such a large sum that
he could not but feel some concern until he had
it in his own hands again.
</p>
<p>After thanking his fellow merchant for keeping
the jar, more earnestly than seemed necessary,
he carried it back to his room in the khan,
and having locked the door he opened it. He
removed the two top layers of olives and was
somewhat surprised not to see the gold. However,
he thought he must have covered the
money more carefully than he had supposed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
He took out more olives, and then still more,
but still there were no signs of the gold.
</p>
<p>Filled with misgivings, Ali Cogia tilted the
jar and emptied out the rest of the olives so
hastily that they rolled all over the floor, but
not a single piece of gold was there.
</p>
<p>The merchant was dismayed. He could
scarcely believe that Abul Hassan would rob
him of his money, and yet there seemed no
other explanation. He knew that the merchant
kept his warehouse locked except when he was
there himself, and that no one was allowed to
visit it but those with whom he was well
acquainted, and then only upon special business.
</p>
<p>Deeply troubled he returned to the merchant&#8217;s
house, determined to demand an explanation
and, if necessary, to force him by
law to return the gold.
</p>
<p>Abul Hassan seemed surprised to see Ali
return so soon. &#8220;Did you forget something?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;Or do you wish to speak to me
upon some business?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you not guess what I have come to
speak to you about?&#8221; asked Ali.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How should I guess? Unless it is to thank
me again for keeping your jar for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Abul Hassan, when I went away I left a
thousand pieces of gold in the jar I placed in
your warehouse. The gold is now gone. I suppose
you saw some way in which you could
use it both for your advantage and my own.
If such is the case, please to give me some receipt
for the money, and I am willing to wait until you
can return it to me, but I think you should have
spoken of the matter when I was here before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Abul Hassan showed the greatest surprise at
this address. &#8220;I do not know what you are
talking about,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I know nothing
about any gold. If there was any in the jar,
which I very much doubt, it must be there still,
for the jar has never been disturbed since you
yourself placed it in my warehouse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The gold certainly was in the jar when I
placed it there, and you must know it, for no one
else could have taken it. No one goes into the
warehouse without your permission, as you
have often told me and then only for some express
purpose.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>Ali Cogia would have said more, but his fellow
merchant interrupted him. &#8220;I repeat I
know nothing of any gold,&#8221; he cried angrily.
&#8220;Go away and do not trouble me any further,
or you will find yourself in difficulties. Do you
not see how your loud talking has gathered a
crowd about my house?&#8221;
</p>
<p>And indeed a number of people had gathered
in front of Abul&#8217;s house, drawn thither by the
sound of the dispute. They listened with curiosity
to what the merchants were saying and
presently became so interested that they began
to discuss the matter among themselves, and to
argue and dispute as to which of the merchants
was in the right.
</p>
<p>At last Ali Cogia, finding that Abul would
confess nothing, said, &#8220;Very well. I see you
are determined to keep the money if possible.
But you shall find it is not as easy to rob me
as you seem to think.&#8221; Then, laying his hand
upon Abul&#8217;s shoulder, he added, &#8220;I summon
you to appear with me before the Cadi, that
he may decide the matter between us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Now this is a summons no true Mussulman
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
can disobey. Abul was compelled to go before
the Cadi with Ali, and a great crowd of people
followed them, eager to know what decision
would be given in the matter by the judge.
</p>
<p>The Cadi listened attentively to all the two
merchants had to say and after reflecting upon
the matter he asked, &#8220;Abul Hassan, are you
ready to swear that you know nothing of the
gold Ali Cogia says he left with you, and that
you did not disturb the jar?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; answered the merchant. &#8220;And indeed
I wish to swear to it,&#8221; and this he did.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you, Ali Cogia; have you any witnesses
to prove there was gold in the jar when
you left it in Abul Hassan&#8217;s warehouse?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Alas! no; no one knew of it but myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it is your word against his. Abul
Hassan has sworn that he did not touch the jar,
and unless you can bring witnesses to your
truth, I cannot compel him to pay you a thousand
pieces of gold that you may never have
lost.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The case was dismissed. Abul Hassan returned
to his home, satisfied and triumphant,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
but Ali Cogia with hanging head and bitterness
of heart.
</p>
<p>But though the Cadi had decided against
him, Ali was not willing to let the matter rest
there. He was determined to have justice done
him, even though he were obliged to appeal to
the Caliph himself.
</p>
<p>At that time Haroun-al-Raschid was Commander
of the Faithful. Every morning Haroun-al-Raschid
went to the mosque to offer
up prayers, accompanied by his Grand Vizier
and Mesrour the Chief Eunuch. As he returned
to the palace all who had complaints to
make or petitions to offer stationed themselves
along the way and gave their complaints and
petitions in written form to Mesrour. Afterward
these papers were presented to the Caliph
that he might read them and decide upon their
merits.
</p>
<p>The day after the Cadi had dismissed the
case of the two merchants, Ali Cogia set out
early in the morning and placed himself beside
the way where he knew the Caliph would pass.
</p>
<p>In his hand he carried his complaint against
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
Abul Hassan, written out in due form. He
waited until Haroun-al-Raschid was returning
from the mosque and then put the paper in
the hand of Mesrour.
</p>
<p>Later, when the Caliph was reading the
papers, he was particularly interested in the one
presented by Ali Cogia: &#8220;This is a curious
case,&#8221; said he to his Vizier, &#8220;and one which it
will be difficult to decide. Order the two merchants
to appear before me to-morrow, and I
will hear what they have to say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That evening the Caliph and his Vizier disguised
themselves, and, attended only by Mesrour,
they went out to wander about the streets
of the city. It was the custom of the Caliph
to do this, as in this way he learned much about
his people, their needs and wants and ways of
life, which would otherwise have been hidden
from him.
</p>
<p>For some time after they set out they heard
and saw nothing of importance, but as they
came near to a court that opened off one of the
streets they heard the voices of a number of
boys who were at play there in the moonlight.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>The Caliph motioned to his Vizier to be silent,
and together they stole to the opening of the
court and looked in. The moon was so bright
that they could see clearly the faces of the boys
at play there. They had gathered about the
tallest and most intelligent-looking lad, who appeared
to be their leader.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us act out some play,&#8221; the leader was
saying. &#8220;I will be the Cadi, and you shall bring
some case before me to be tried.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; cried another. &#8220;But what case
shall we take?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us take the case of Ali Cogia and Abul
Hassan. We all know about that, and if it had
come before me I should have decided it differently
from the way the Cadi did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>All the boys agreed to this by clapping their
hands.
</p>
<p>The leader then appointed one boy to take
the part of Ali Cogia and another to be Abul
Hassan. Still others were chosen to be guards
and merchants and so on.
</p>
<p>The Caliph and his Vizier were much amused
by this play of the boys, and they sat down upon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
a bench so conveniently placed that they could
see all that went on without themselves being
observed.
</p>
<p>The pretended Cadi took his seat and commanded
that Abul Hassan and Ali Cogia should
be brought before him. &#8220;And let Ali Cogia
bring with him the jar of olives in which he
said he hid the gold,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>The lads who were taking the parts of Ali
Cogia and Abul Hassan were now led forward
by some of the other boys and were told by the
pretended Cadi to state their cases. This they
did clearly, for the case had been much talked
about by their elders, and they were well acquainted
with all the circumstances and had
discussed them among themselves.
</p>
<p>The pretended Cadi listened attentively to
what they said, and then addressing the lad
who took the part of Abul he asked, &#8220;Abul
Hassan, are you willing to swear that you have
not touched the jar nor opened it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The pretended merchant said he was.
</p>
<p>The lad then asked, &#8220;Has Ali Cogia brought
the jar of olives into court with him?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is here,&#8221; said the boys who were taking
the parts of officers of the court.
</p>
<p>The feigned Cadi ordered them to place the
jar before him, which they pretended to do.
He then went through the motions of lifting
the lid and examining the olives and even of
tasting one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;These are very fine olives,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Ali
Cogia, when did you say you placed this jar in
the warehouse?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was when I left Bagdad, seven years ago,&#8221;
answered the pretended merchant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Abul Hassan, is that so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boy who acted the part of Abul said that
it was.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let the olive merchants be brought into
court,&#8221; commanded the pretended Cadi.
</p>
<p>The boys who were taking the parts of olive
merchants now came forward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; said the feigned Cadi, &#8220;how long
is it possible to keep olives?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;However great the care that is taken,&#8221;
they answered, &#8220;it is impossible to preserve
them for more than three years. After that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
time they lose both color and flavor and are
fit for nothing but to be thrown out.&#8221; The
boys spoke with assurance, for their fathers were
among the most expert olive dealers in the city,
and they knew what they were talking about.
</p>
<p>The pretended Cadi then bade them examine
the olives in the jar and tell him how old they
were. &#8220;As you see,&#8221; said he, &#8220;they are of a fine
color, large, and of a delicious fresh taste.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The feigned merchants pretended to examine
them carefully and then announced the olives
were of that year&#8217;s growth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Ali Cogia says he left them with Abul
Hassan seven years ago, and to this statement
Abul Hassan agrees.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is impossible they should have been kept
that long,&#8221; answered the feigned merchants.
&#8220;As we tell you, after three years olives are
worth nothing, and at the end of seven years
they would be utterly spoiled. These are fresh
olives and of this year&#8217;s growth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boy who took the part of Abul Hassan
would have tried to explain and make excuses,
but the pretended Cadi bade him be silent.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You have sworn falsely,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and also
proved yourself a thief.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then to the pretended guards he cried, &#8220;Take
him away and let him be hung according to
the law.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The feigned guards dragged away the boy
who was acting Abul Hassan and then, the play
being finished, all the boys clapped their hands
and shouted their approval of the way the
feigned Cadi had conducted the case.
</p>
<p>Seeing that all was over the Caliph withdrew,
beckoning to the Vizier and Mesrour to follow
him. After they had gone a short distance,
Haroun-al-Raschid turned to the Vizier and
asked him what he thought of the play they had
just witnessed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said the Vizier, &#8220;that the pretended
Cadi showed a wisdom and a judgment
that the real Cadi would do well to imitate. I
also think the boy is a lad of remarkable intelligence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my own thought,&#8221; replied the Caliph.
&#8220;Moreover I have a further thought. You
know this very case between Ali Cogia and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
Abul Hassan is to appear before me to-morrow,
I have it in mind to send you to bring this boy
to the palace, and I will then let him conduct
this case in reality as he has to-day in play.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Vizier applauded this plan, and he and
his master returned to the palace, still talking
of the boy.
</p>
<p>The next day the Vizier went back to the
court they had visited the evening before, and
after looking about he found the lad who had
taken the part of the Cadi sitting in a doorway.
The Vizier approached him and spoke to him
in a kind and friendly manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My boy,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I have come here by
order of the Commander of the Faithful. Last
evening, when you were acting your play, he
overheard all that was said, and he wishes to
see you at the palace to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boy was alarmed when he heard this,
grew pale, and showed great uneasiness.
&#8220;Have I done something wrong?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;If I have I did it unknowingly, and I hope I
am not to be punished for something I did
without intention.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You have done no wrong,&#8221; answered the
Vizier, &#8220;and it is not to punish you that the
Caliph has sent for you. Indeed he is very
much pleased with your conduct, and his sending
for you in this manner is a great honor.&#8221;
He then told the lad what it was the Caliph
wished him to do.
</p>
<p>Instead of being put at ease by this the lad
showed even greater discomfort. &#8220;This seems
a strange thing for me to do,&#8221; said he:&mdash;&#8220;to
decide a case between two grown men&mdash;I who
am only a child. I am afraid I will not be able
to please the Caliph, and that he will be angry
with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Conduct the case as wisely as you did last
night when you were playing,&#8221; answered the
Vizier, &#8220;and the Caliph will not be displeased
with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boy then asked permission to go and tell
his mother where he was going and for what
purpose, and to this the Vizier consented.
</p>
<p>When the lad&#8217;s mother heard that he was to
go to the palace to act as judge in a case of such
importance she could hardly believe her ears.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
She was frightened lest the lad should in some
way offend the Caliph by saying or doing something
ill-judged.
</p>
<p>The lad tried to reassure her, though he himself
was far from being at ease.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If the Caliph was pleased with the way I
conducted the case last night I do not think he
can be so very much displeased with me to-day,&#8221;
said he; &#8220;for I feel sure that only in
this way can we discover the truth between the
two merchants.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the lad returned to the Vizier he looked
very grave, and as they went along together on
their way to the palace the Vizier tried in every
way to put him more at ease and give him confidence.
</p>
<p>Immediately upon their arrival at the palace
they were shown into the room where the
Caliph was sitting. Haroun-al-Raschid greeted
the boy with no less kindness than the Vizier
had shown and asked him if he understood
the purpose for which he had been brought
thither.
</p>
<p>The lad said he did.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then let the two merchants come in,&#8221; said
the Caliph.
</p>
<p>Ali Cogia and Abul Hassan were at once
brought in by the officers of the court. Ali
Cogia brought with him the jar of olives, for so
he had been commanded to do.
</p>
<p>The Cadi who had judged between the two
merchants had also been ordered to attend, and
he entered and took the place assigned to him.
</p>
<p>The Caliph then turned to the lad and bade
him open the case by bidding the merchants
tell their stories, and this, after a moment&#8217;s
pause, the lad did.
</p>
<p>Ali Cogia told his story just as he had before,
stating that he had left with Abul Hassan seven
years before a thousand pieces of gold packed
in a jar and covered over with olives.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this the jar you left with Abul Hassan?&#8221;
asked the boy, pointing to the jar Ali had
brought into court.
</p>
<p>Ali stated that it was.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Abul Hassan, do you also say this is the jar
Ali Cogia left with you?&#8221; asked the lad.
</p>
<p>Abul answered that it was. He also asked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
to be allowed to take his oath that the jar had
not been disturbed after it was left in his warehouse
until Ali Cogia had returned and removed
it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is not necessary at present,&#8221; answered
the boy. &#8220;First let some expert olive merchants
be brought in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Several olive dealers, the most expert in the
city, had been sent for, and they now came
forward.
</p>
<p>The lad asked these real merchants the same
questions he had asked of the feigned merchants
the night before. &#8220;How long,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is it
possible to keep olives good?&#8221;
</p>
<p>And the merchants answered, as had the boys,
&#8220;Not more than three years, for no matter how
carefully they have been packed, after that time
they lose both color and flavor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look in that jar,&#8221; said the lad, &#8220;and tell
us how long you think those olives have been
kept there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The merchants examined the olives with the
greatest care, and then they all agreed that the
olives were of that year&#8217;s growth and quite fresh.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And do you not think it possible they may
have been kept a year or so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it is not possible,&#8221; answered the merchants.
&#8220;We know, of a surety, as we have
already said, that these olives are of this year&#8217;s
growth, and have only recently been packed in
the jar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When Ali Cogia heard this he gave a cry of
surprise, but Abul Hassan was silent; his face
grew as pale as ashes, and his legs failed under
him, for he knew that the merchants, in saying
this, had pronounced sentence against him.
</p>
<p>But the lad turned to the Caliph and begged
that he might now be allowed to hand over the
case to him. &#8220;When I pronounced sentence last
night, it was but in play,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But this
is not play. A man&#8217;s life is at stake, and I dare
not pronounce sentence upon him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>To this request the Caliph agreed. &#8220;Abul
Hassan, you have condemned yourself,&#8221; he said.
He then bade the guards take Abul Hassan
away and execute him according to the law.
</p>
<p>Before the wretched man was hanged, however,
he confessed his guilt and told where he had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
hidden the thousand pieces of gold that belonged
to Ali Cogia.
</p>
<p>After Abul had been led away the Caliph
caressed and praised the lad for conducting the
case so wisely and with so much judgment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As for you,&#8221; said he to the Cadi, &#8220;you have
not shown the wisdom I demand from my
judges. Learn from this child that such cases
are not to be dismissed lightly, but to be inquired
into with judgment and care. Otherwise
it may go ill with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Cadi retired, full of shame, but the
Caliph ordered that a hundred pieces of gold
should be given to the boy and that he should
be sent home to his mother with honor.

<h2>OH!</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Cossack Story</span></h3>
</div>

<p>There was once a man who had one son,
and he was so lazy that he would not work
at all. The father apprenticed him to a tailor,
but the lad went to sleep between the stitches.
He apprenticed him to a cobbler and the lad
only sat and yawned instead of driving pegs.
What to do with him the man did not know.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said the father one day, &#8220;we will
go out into the wide world. It may be that
somewhere or other we will find a master who
can make you work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lad was very good-natured. &#8220;Very well,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;I am willing&#8221;; and he arose and
stretched himself and yawned, and then he was
ready to set out.
</p>
<p>The father put on his cap and took a staff in
his hand, and then he was ready, too.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>The two of them journeyed along together,
in step and out of step, and after a while they
came to a deep wood. When they were well
into it, the father grew so weary that he had to
sit down and rest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! what have I done that I should have
such a lazy son!&#8221; he cried.
</p>
<p>At once a little old, wrinkled, weazened man,
all dressed in green, with a green face, green
hair, and a green beard stood before them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you call me,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and what
do you want?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not call you,&#8221; answered the man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you did call me, for I heard you. Did
not you call &#8216;Oh&#8217;? And that is my name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I said, &#8216;Oh, what have I done to have such
a lazy son,&#8217;&#8221; replied the man, &#8220;but I did not
call you, for I did not know that was your
name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Green one looked closely at the lad.
&#8220;Is he so lazy?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;He looks a
stout, healthy fellow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the worst of it,&#8221; answered the father.
&#8220;He is so stout and healthy that he eats me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
out of house and home, and not one stroke will
he do to pay for it. I have tried to apprentice
him to different masters, but they soon weary
of him and drive him out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well; I will take him as an apprentice
myself,&#8221; answered the little man. &#8220;Leave him
here with me for a year. Come back at the end
of that time, and if you know him again and are
able to choose him out from among my other
apprentices, then you shall take him home with
you, but if not, then he shall serve with me a
year longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Very well, the father was willing to agree
to that. It would only be for a year, for of
course he would recognize his own son anywhere.
So he left the lad with Oh and went
on home again.
</p>
<p>Oh took the lad down into the country that
lies beneath this earth, and the way was not
long. There everything was green. Oh&#8217;s house
was made of green rushes. His wife was green
and his daughters were green and his dog was
green, and when they gave the lad food to eat,
it was green also.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>The oldest daughter would have been a
beauty if she had not been green all over&mdash;eyes,
hair, and all. As soon as she saw the lad
she loved him and would have been glad to
have him for a husband, but he had no fancy
for her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I marry,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it shall be some
girl who is good red and white flesh and blood
like myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Oh. &#8220;After you have
lived here for a while you will be glad enough to
have her for a wife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lad lived down in the under country for
a year, and Oh taught him much magic, and he
was very useful to the old Green One.
</p>
<p>But at the end of the year the father came
back in search of his son. He stopped at the
very same spot in the forest where he had
stopped before and cried out in a loud voice,
&#8220;Oh! Oh! I would like to see my son.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At once Oh appeared before him. &#8220;Come
with me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but remember our bargain.
If you know your son when you see him he is
yours again, but if you do not know him, then he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
must stay with me and serve me still another
year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man was very willing to agree, for it
would be a strange thing if he did not know his
own son when he saw him.
</p>
<p>Oh led him down the short way to the land
that is under this, and when he got there the
man stared about him in wonder. Never had
he seen so many green things in all his life
before.
</p>
<p>Oh took a handful of corn and scattered it
about, calling as he did so. Then a great number
of cocks that were pecking about the place
came running and began to pick up the corn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me now, which of these is your son?&#8221;
asked Oh, &#8220;for one of them is he.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man stared and scratched his head and
stared again, but he could not tell, for one cock
was just like another. He had to own that he
could not tell which was his son.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Oh. &#8220;Then you will have
to go home without him. Come back at the
end of another year, and then if you know him
from his mates you shall take him home with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
you, but if not then he shall stay with me a
twelvemonth longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That did not suit the man at all, but he could
not say no, for that was what the bargain had
been.
</p>
<p>At the end of the year the man came back to
the forest again and called upon Oh, and Oh
was quickly before him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along,&#8221; said Oh. &#8220;You surely ought
to know your son when you see him. If you do
he shall go home with you, and I shall not say
no to it, but if not then he shall stay with me a
year longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the man heard this he was troubled,
for he feared the Green One meant to play some
trick on him as he had before, and he wanted
his son home again, lazy or not. Moreover the
lad&#8217;s mother was grieving for him.
</p>
<p>Oh led the man down to the underworld and
over to a field where a flock of rams was grazing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All these are my servants,&#8221; said Oh, &#8220;and
one of them is your son. Look well and tell me
which is he, for unless you can choose him out
he must stay here with me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>The man looked and looked, but he could not
tell which of the rams was his son, for they all
looked alike to him, so he had to go home without
him.
</p>
<p>When the lad&#8217;s mother heard of this second
trick the Green One had played on her husband
she wept bitterly. &#8220;If we cannot find some way
to get round him, we will never have the lad
back again,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true,&#8221; said the man; &#8220;but if our
son looks like a cock, how can I tell him from
other cocks; and if he looks like a ram, how can
I tell him from other rams?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Well, time slipped by, and the man and his
wife grew poorer and poorer, for they were
growing old, and they needed a young body in
the house to work for them.
</p>
<p>When it was about time for the man to set
out for Oh&#8217;s house his wife said to him, &#8220;See
now! we have nothing left in the house but a
small loaf and a bit of honeycomb. But we
can do better than fill our stomach with them.
Do you take them to the old Wise Woman who
lives over beyond the hill. Tell her they are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
a gift, and then ask her what we can do to meet
the tricks of the little old Green One.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man did as his wife bade him, though he
was hungry and would have been glad of a bit
of the bread himself.
</p>
<p>The Wise Woman was pleased with the gift,
and thanked the man kindly. Then the man
told her all his troubles and asked her how he
was to get his son back again from Oh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; said the old woman. &#8220;Oh would
gladly keep your son with him as a husband for
his daughter, and if you do not bring the lad
away with you this time, you will never have
him back. This time Oh will show you a flock
of doves, and one of them will be your son.
Look closely at them, and the one that has tears
in its eyes is he, for only a human soul can weep.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The father thanked the old woman and hurried
back home again, and very soon after it
was time to set out for Oh&#8217;s house.
</p>
<p>The man travelled along till he came to the
wood and the place where he had come twice
already, and he stood there and cried, &#8220;Oh!
Oh!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>Then Oh appeared before him. &#8220;Here I
am,&#8221; said Oh, &#8220;ready and waiting for you.
This time, as before, I tell you that if you
know your son when you see him you shall take
him away with you, but if, this time, you do not
know him, then he is mine forever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the man, &#8220;that is a bargain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Oh took him down to the underworld.
He called to a flock of doves that was perched
on the roof and scattered a handful of peas on
the ground for them. The doves flew down all
about them and began to peck up the peas; but
one dove would not eat but sat mournfully on a
low bough and looked at them, and its eyes
were full of tears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This one is my son,&#8221; cried the man, pointing
to the dove that wept.
</p>
<p>As soon as he said this the dove changed its
shape and became a young man, and this was
the son, though he had become so fine and tall
and handsome in these three years that his
father could scarcely recognize him.
</p>
<p>Then Oh was in a fine rage. He danced with
fury and tore his beard.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;he is yours now, but
you shall not keep him long, and when I once
get him back again he is mine forever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the lad paid no heed to his threats. He
and his father were soon on the upper earth
again, and they set out for home, one foot before
the other.
</p>
<p>On the way the father told the lad how badly
it had gone with him and the mother in the
past years; of how poor they were, and of how
their hut was tumbling to pieces, and how their
cow had died.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said the lad. &#8220;I learned quite a
bit of magic from the Green One, and that should
help us out now. Do you hear the huntsmen
winding their horns farther on in the open?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Yes, the father heard them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will turn myself into a greyhound,&#8221; said the
lad. &#8220;The hunt is coming this way, and when
the huntsmen see me they will want to buy me.
Ask them three hundred dollars for me; no more,
no less, but when they take me do not leave the
leash on me, whatever you do. Take it off and
put it in your pocket, and then all will be well
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
with me. Fail to do this, and misfortune will
surely overtake me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The father promised to do as the son said,
and then the lad turned himself into a greyhound,
and he was so sleek and handsome that
the man could not admire him enough; but
about his neck was an old, worn leash that did
not look as though it were worth a penny. It
seemed a pity to leave it on the neck of such a
handsome dog.
</p>
<p>The man went on a little further and then he
came to where a grand nobleman and his friends
were hunting a hare. They had a pack of dogs
with them but the hare had outrun them.
</p>
<p>When the nobleman saw the man and the
greyhound he stopped his horse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a fine greyhound you have there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is,&#8221; answered the man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think it could course down the hare
we are chasing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Yes, the man was sure it could.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let me have it and I will pay you a
good price for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Very well, he could have it for three hundred
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
dollars, but that was without the leash; the
leash was not for sale.
</p>
<p>The nobleman laughed aloud, &#8220;when the dog
is mine,&#8221; he said, &#8220;he shall have a golden leash,
for that one you have is fit for nothing but the
ash heap.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The nobleman then paid the man three hundred
dollars and unfastened the leash from the
dog&#8217;s neck.
</p>
<p>Away he flew like the wind and soon caught
the hare. But when the hunters reached the
spot where the hare lay they could see nothing
of the dog. Only a tall and handsome youth
stood there, and he was flushed and hot as
though he had been running.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen my greyhound, a sleek and
handsome dog?&#8221; asked the nobleman.
</p>
<p>No, the youth had not seen any dog.
</p>
<p>The nobleman called and whistled, and he
and his huntsman hunted far and near, but they
never found the greyhound.
</p>
<p>As for the lad he set out on the road his father
had taken and soon caught up with him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a very pretty trick,&#8221; said the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
father; &#8220;but after all three hundred dollars is
not much. It will barely buy us a cow and
clothes and put a new roof on the hut.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but that is not the only trick I know,&#8221;
answered the son. &#8220;Look at the hill over yonder
and tell me what you see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The father looked. &#8220;I see a company of fine
ladies and gentlemen,&#8221; answered the father,
&#8220;and they are flying their falcons.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will change myself into a falcon, and when
you have come to where they are you shall loose
me, and I will strike down a quail. Then they
will want to buy me. Sell me for three hundred
dollars, no more, no less. But whatever you
do take off my hood and keep it, or misfortune
will surely overtake us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The father promised he would do this, and
then the lad turned himself into a falcon and
perched upon his father&#8217;s hand.
</p>
<p>Presently the father came up to where the
ladies and gentlemen were at their sport. They
loosed their falcons, and the falcons flew after
the quail, but always they failed to strike, and
the quail escaped.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That is poor sport,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;I can
show you better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He took off the hood and cast his falcon at
the quail, and it quickly struck down its prey.
</p>
<p>The gentlemen and ladies were astonished at
the quickness of the falcon and at the beauty of
its feathers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sell us the bird,&#8221; they said.
</p>
<p>Yes, the man was willing to do that, but his
price was three hundred dollars without the
hood; the hood was not for sale for love nor
money.
</p>
<p>All the fine folk began to laugh. &#8220;What do
we want with that old hood?&#8221; they cried. &#8220;We
will give the bird a hood that is worthy of a
king.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So the man took the three hundred dollars
and the hood and went on his way.
</p>
<p>The one who had bought the falcon cast it
at a quail, and it struck down its prey as before,
but when the hunters reached the place where
the birds had fallen they saw no falcon, but only
a handsome young man who stood there looking
down at the dead quail.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What became of the falcon that was here?&#8221;
they asked.
</p>
<p>But the youth had seen no falcon.
</p>
<p>He set out and soon overtook his father, who
had not gone far. &#8220;And now art thou content?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Six hundred dollars is not a fortune,&#8221; answered
the man. &#8220;Since you have done so well
you might have done better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; answered the son. &#8220;We are now
coming to a town where they are holding a fair.
I will change myself into a horse, and you shall
take me there and sell me for a thousand dollars,&mdash;no
more, no less. But heed what I say.
Do not sell the halter whatever you do, or evil
will surely come of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the father. &#8220;I will remember.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The son then changed himself into a coal-black
horse. His skin was like satin, his eyes
like jewels, and when he moved, his hoofs
scarcely seemed to touch the ground. But
around his neck was an old leather halter that
was scarcely fit for an old farm nag.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>The father led the horse on to where the fair
was being held, and at once a crowd gathered
around him, all bidding for the horse. Some
offered him more and some less.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The price is a thousand dollars,&#8221; said the
father, &#8220;no more, no less. But that is without
the halter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the people all laughed. &#8220;Who wants
the halter?&#8221; they cried. &#8220;What we offer is for
the horse alone. The halter we would not take
as a gift.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then a rough looking, black-haired gypsy
elbowed his way through the crowd. He was
really the Green One who had taken on this
form, though this the man did not know.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will give you two thousand,&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;One thousand for the horse and one thousand
for the halter, but I will not have one without
the other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the crowd heard this they laughed
louder than ever. They thought the gypsy was
crazy to offer such a price.
</p>
<p>As for the father he stood there gaping and
he did not know what to do.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The price of the horse is a thousand dollars,&#8221;
he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And a thousand for the halter,&#8221; said the
gypsy.
</p>
<p>Well, two thousand dollars seemed a fortune
to the man. Moreover he did not see what
harm it could do to sell the halter too.
</p>
<p>So he let the gypsy have the horse and the
halter as well, and the gypsy paid him two
thousand dollars and led the horse away.
</p>
<p>And now the lad could not change himself
back into his human shape, because the halter
held him, and this Oh knew very well.
</p>
<p>He led the horse back to the forest and down
to the world that is under this. &#8220;Now I have
you again,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and this time you shall
not escape me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then he called to his youngest daughter and
bade her take the horse down to the river to
drink.
</p>
<p>When she had brought the horse to the river
bank it said to her. &#8220;Loosen, I pray of thee,
the halter, that I may drink more easily.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the girl, who was a stupid wench,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
loosened the halter. At once the lad slipped out
of it and changed himself into a perch and fled
away down the river.
</p>
<p>But the Green One knew what had happened.
He rushed down to the river and changed himself
into a pike and pursued after the perch.
</p>
<p>On and on they went, but the pike swam
faster than the perch and was just about to
catch it when the perch sprang clear out of the
water.
</p>
<p>The daughter of the Tsar was walking by the
river, and she was such a beauty that it made
the heart ache to look at her. On her arm she
carried a basket.
</p>
<p>As the perch leaped he changed himself into
a ruby ring and fell into the basket.
</p>
<p>The damsel was very much astonished to
see the ring in her basket. She did not know
where it had come from. She looked up, and
she looked down, but she could see no one who
could have thrown the ring.
</p>
<p>Then she took it up and slid it upon her
finger, and at once she loved it as she had never
loved anything in all her life before.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>She carried it to her father and said to him,
&#8220;Look what a pretty ring I have found!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered her father, &#8220;but where did
you find it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I found it in my basket, but how it came
there I do not know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Tsaritsa&#8217;s mother also admired the ring
very much. Never had they seen such a brilliant
and flashing ruby before.
</p>
<p>Now at first, after the perch leaped out of the
river and into the Tsaritsa&#8217;s basket, Oh did not
know what had become of him. He was obliged
to go home and get out his magic books, and
then he soon learned where the lad was.
</p>
<p>He then changed himself into a venerable
merchant, clothed in velvet robes and with a
long white beard. He broke a stick from an ash
tree and changed it into a horse, and mounted
on it and rode away to the Tsar&#8217;s palace.
</p>
<p>Then he asked to speak with the Tsar, and so
old and venerable did he look that they would
not refuse him, but brought him before the Tsar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What dost thou want, old man?&#8221; asked the
Tsar.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Your majesty,&#8221; answered the Green One, &#8220;I
have had a great loss. I was crossing the river
in a boat, and I had with me a very handsome
ruby ring that I was carrying with me to my
master, who is also a Tsar. Unfortunately I
lost the ring overboard, and I thought it might
perchance have washed up on the shore and
have been picked up by one of thy servants.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was thy ring like?&#8221; asked the Tsar.
</p>
<p>Then the pretended merchant described the
Tsaritsa&#8217;s ring exactly.
</p>
<p>The Tsar sent for his daughter, and she came
with the ring on her finger, for she would not
take it off, either night or day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see thy ring,&#8221; said the Tsar.
</p>
<p>He took her hand in his and examined the
ring carefully, and it was in every respect exactly
as the Green One had described it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this thy ring?&#8221; the Tsar asked of the
merchant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, your majesty, it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said the Tsar to his daughter, &#8220;it is
right that thou shouldst return it to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Tsaritsa wept and implored. She offered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
the merchant her pearls and every other gem
she had if he would but let her keep the ring,
but he refused.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, then, it shall be neither thine
nor mine,&#8221; cried the Tsaritsa, and she drew the
ring from her finger and dashed it against the
wall.
</p>
<p>At once the ring changed into a hundred
millet seeds and was scattered all over the floor.
</p>
<p>But the Green One as quickly changed himself
into a cock and ran about this way and that,
pecking up the millet seeds and swallowing
them. Ninety-nine millet seeds he found and
ate, but the hundredth he did not find, because
it had fallen beside the Tsaritsa&#8217;s foot, and the
hem of her robe covered it.
</p>
<p>As soon as the cock had swallowed the ninety-ninth
seed he sprang upon the window sill,
and stretched his neck and crowed with triumph.
</p>
<p>But the hundredth seed was really the lad,
and in that moment he changed himself back
into his human form, and before the cock knew
what had happened, he caught hold of it and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
wrung its neck and that was the end of Oh and
his magic.
</p>
<p>As for the Tsaritsa, no sooner had she seen the
lad than her heart went out to him, and she
loved him even better than she had her ring,
and she declared that he and he only should be
her husband.
</p>
<p>The Tsar did not know what to say to that,
for it did not seem fitting that his daughter
should marry a common man. But the Tsaritsa
begged and plead with him till he could no
longer withstand her.
</p>
<p>So she and the lad were married with great
pomp and magnificence.
</p>
<p>His old father and mother were bidden to the
wedding, and they could hardly believe their
eyes when they saw their son stand there in
those costly robes with a crown upon his
head and the Tsaritsa beside him as his bride.
</p>
<p>The old people were given a house to live in
and plenty of money to spend, and they all
lived in peace and happiness forever after.

<h2>THE TALKING EGGS</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Story from Louisiana</span></h3>
</div>

<p>There was once a widow who had two daughters,
one named Rose and the other Blanche.
</p>
<p>Blanche was good and beautiful and gentle,
but the mother cared nothing for her and gave
her only hard words and harder blows; but she
loved Rose as she loved the apple of her eye,
because Rose was exactly like herself, coarse-looking,
and with a bad temper and a sharp
tongue.
</p>
<p>Blanche was obliged to work all day, but Rose
sat in a chair with folded hands as though she
were a fine lady, with nothing in the world to
do.
</p>
<p>One day the mother sent Blanche to the well
for a bucket of water. When she came to the
well she saw an old woman sitting there. The
woman was so very old that her nose and her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
chin met, and her cheeks were as wrinkled as a
walnut.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good day to you, child,&#8221; said the old woman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good day, auntie,&#8221; answered Blanche.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you give me a drink of water?&#8221; asked
the old woman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gladly,&#8221; said Blanche. She drew the bucket
full of water, and tilted it so the old woman
could drink, but the crone lifted the bucket in
her two hands as though it were a feather and
drank and drank till the water was all gone.
Blanche had never seen any one drink so much;
not a drop was left in the bucket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;May heaven bless you!&#8221; said the old
woman, and then she went on her way.
</p>
<p>And now Blanche had to fill the bucket again,
and it seemed as though her arms would break,
she was so tired.
</p>
<p>When she went home her mother struck her
because she had tarried so long at the well.
Her blows made Blanche weep. Rose laughed
when she saw her crying.
</p>
<p>The very next day the mother became angry
over nothing and gave Blanche such a beating
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
that the girl ran away into the woods; she
would not stay in the house any longer. She
ran on and on, deeper and deeper into the
forest, and there, in the deepest part, she met the
old woman she had seen beside the well.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going, my child? And why
are you weeping so bitterly?&#8221; asked the crone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am weeping because my mother beat
me,&#8221; answered Blanche; &#8220;and now I have
run away from her, and I do not know where
to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then come with me,&#8221; said the old woman.
&#8220;I will give you a shelter and a bite to eat, and
in return there is many a task you can do for
me. Only, whatever you may see as we journey
along together you must not laugh nor say anything
about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Blanche promised she would not, and then
she trudged away at the old woman&#8217;s side.
</p>
<p>After a while they came to a hedge so thick
and wide and so set with thorns that Blanche
did not see how they could pass it without being
torn to pieces, but the old hag waved her staff,
and the branches parted before them and left
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
the path clear. Then, as they passed, the hedge
closed together behind them.
</p>
<p>Blanche wondered but said nothing.
</p>
<p>A little further on they saw two axes fighting
together with no hand to hold them. That
seemed a curious thing, but still Blanche said
nothing.
</p>
<p>Further on were two arms that strove against
each other without a sound. Still Blanche was
silent.
</p>
<p>Further on again two heads fought, butting
each other like goats. Blanche looked and
stared but said no word. Then the heads called
to her. &#8220;You are a good girl, Blanche.
Heaven will reward you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After that she and her companion came to the
hut where the old woman lived. They went in,
and the hag bade Blanche gather some sticks of
wood and build a fire. Meanwhile she sat
down beside the hearth and took off her head.
She put it in her lap and began to comb
her hair and twist it up.
</p>
<p>Blanche was frightened, but she held her
peace and built the fire as the old woman had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
directed. When it was burning the old woman
put back her head in place, and told Blanche to
look on the shelf behind the door. &#8220;There you
will find a bone; put it on to boil for our dinners,&#8221;
said she.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_3' id='linki_3'></a>
<img src='images/c002.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
She sat down beside the hearth and took off her head.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Blanche found the bone and put it on to boil,
though it seemed a poor dinner.
</p>
<p>The old woman gave her a grain of rice and
bade her grind it in the mortar. Blanche put
the rice in the mortar and ground it with the
pestle, and before she had been grinding two
minutes the mortar was full of rice, enough for
both of them and to spare.
</p>
<p>When it was time for dinner she looked in the
pot and it was full of good, fresh meat. She
and the old woman had all they could eat.
</p>
<p>After dinner was over the old woman lay
down on the bed. &#8220;Oh, my back! Oh, my
poor back! How it does ache,&#8221; groaned she.
&#8220;Come hither and rub it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Blanche came over and uncovered the old
crone&#8217;s back, and she was surprised when she
saw it; it was as hard and ridgy as a turtle&#8217;s.
Still she said nothing but began to rub it. She
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
rubbed and rubbed till the skin was all worn
off her hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is good,&#8221; said the old woman. &#8220;Now
I feel better.&#8221; She sat up and drew her clothes
about her. Then she blew upon Blanche&#8217;s
hand, and at once it was as well as ever.
</p>
<p>Blanche stayed with the old woman for three
days and served her well; she neither asked
questions nor spoke of what she saw.
</p>
<p>At the end of that time her mistress said to
her, &#8220;My child, you have now been with me
for three days, and I can keep you here no
longer. You have served me well, and you
shall not lack your reward. Go to the chicken-house
and look in the nests. You will find there
a number of eggs. Take all that say to you,
&#8216;Take me,&#8217; but those that say, &#8216;Do not take
me,&#8217; you must not touch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Blanche went out to the chicken-house and
looked in the nests. There were ever so many
eggs; some of them were large and beautiful
and white and shining and so pretty that she
longed to take them, but each time she stretched
out her hand toward one it cried, &#8220;Do not take
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
me.&#8221; Then she did not touch it. There were
also some small, brown, muddy-looking eggs, and
these called to her, &#8220;Take me!&#8221; So those
were the ones she took.
</p>
<p>When she came back to the house the old
woman looked to see which ones she had taken.
&#8220;You have done what was right,&#8221; said she,
&#8220;and you will not regret it.&#8221; She then showed
Blanche a path by which she could return to
her own home without having to pass through
the thorn hedge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As you go throw the eggs behind you,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;and you will see what you shall see.
One thing I can tell you, your mother will be
glad enough to have you home again after that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Blanche thanked her for the eggs, though
she did not think much of them, and started
out. After she had gone a little way she threw
one of the eggs over her shoulder. It broke on
the path, and a whole bucket full of gold poured
out from it. Blanche had never seen so much
gold in all her life before.
</p>
<p>She gathered it up in her apron and went a
little farther, and then she threw another egg
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
over her shoulder. When it broke a whole
bucket full of diamonds poured out over the
path. They fairly dazzled the eyes, they were
so bright and sparkling.
</p>
<p>Blanche gathered them up, and went on
farther, and threw another egg over her shoulder.
Out from it came all sorts of fine clothes, embroidered
and set all over with gems. Blanche
put them on, and then she looked like the most
beautiful princess that ever was seen.
</p>
<p>She threw the last egg over her shoulder, and
there stood a magnificent golden coach drawn
by four white horses, and with coachman and
footman all complete. Blanche stepped into
the coach, and away they rolled to the door of
her mother&#8217;s house without her ever having to
give an order or speak a word.
</p>
<p>When her mother and sister heard the coach
draw up at the door they ran out to see who
was coming. There sat Blanche in the coach,
all dressed in fine clothes, and with her lap full
of gold and diamonds.
</p>
<p>Her mother welcomed her in and then began
to question her as to how she had become so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
rich and fine. It did not take her long to
learn the whole story.
</p>
<p>Nothing would satisfy her but that Rose
should go out into the forest, and find the old
woman, and get her to take her home with her
as a servant.
</p>
<p>Rose grumbled and muttered, for she was a
lazy girl and had no wish to work for any one,
whatever the reward, and she would rather
have sat at home and dozed; but her mother
pushed her out of the door, and so she had to
go.
</p>
<p>She slouched along through the forest, and
presently she met the old woman. &#8220;Will you
take me home with you for a servant?&#8221; asked
Rose.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come with me if you will,&#8221; said the old
woman, &#8220;but whatever you may see do not
laugh nor say anything about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a great laugher,&#8221; said Rose, and then
she walked along with the old woman through
the forest.
</p>
<p>Presently they came to the thorn hedge, and
it opened before them just as it had when
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
Blanche had journeyed there. &#8220;That is a good
thing,&#8221; said Rose. &#8220;If it had not done that,
not a step farther would I have gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Soon they came to the place where the axes
were fighting. Rose looked and stared, and
then she began to laugh.
</p>
<p>A little later they came to where the arms
were striving together, and at that Rose laughed
harder still. But when she came to where the
heads were butting each other, she laughed
hardest of all. Then the heads opened their
mouths and spoke to her. &#8220;Evil you are, and
evil you will be, and no luck will come through
your laughter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Soon after they arrived at the old woman&#8217;s
house. She pushed open the door, and they
went in. The crone bade Rose gather sticks
and build a fire; she herself sat down by the
hearth, and took off her head, and began to
comb and plait her hair.
</p>
<p>Rose stood and looked and laughed. &#8220;What
a stupid old woman you are,&#8221; she said, &#8220;to
take off your head to comb your hair!&#8221; and
she laughed and laughed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>The old woman was very angry. Still she
did not say anything. She put on her head and
made up the fire herself. Rose would not do
anything. She would not even put the pot on
the fire. She was as lazy at the old woman&#8217;s
house as she was at home, and the old crone
was obliged to do the work herself. At the end
of three days she said to Rose. &#8220;Now you
must go home, for you are of no use to anybody,
and I will keep you here no longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Rose. &#8220;I am willing
enough to go, but first pay me my wages.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the old woman. &#8220;I will
pay you. Go out to the chicken-house and
look for eggs. All the eggs that say, &#8216;Take me&#8217;,
you may have, but if they say, &#8216;Do not take me&#8217;,
then you must not touch them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rose went out to the chicken-house and
hunted about and soon found the eggs. Some
were large and beautiful and white, and of these
she gathered up an apronful, though they cried
to her ever so loudly, &#8220;Do not take me.&#8221; Some
of the eggs were small and ugly and brown.
&#8220;Take me! Take me!&#8221; they cried.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A pretty thing if I were to take you,&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;You are fit for nothing but to be
thrown out on the hillside.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She did not return to the hut to thank the
old woman or bid her good-by but set off for
home the way she had come. When she
reached the thorn thicket it had closed together
again. She had to force her way through, and
the thorns scratched her face and hands and
almost tore the clothes off her back. Still she
comforted herself with the thought of all the
riches she would get out of the eggs.
</p>
<p>She went a little farther, and then she took
the eggs out of her apron. &#8220;Now I will have
a fine coach to travel in the rest of the way,&#8221;
said she, &#8220;and gay clothes and diamonds and
money,&#8221; and she threw the eggs down in the
path, and they all broke at once. But no
clothes, nor jewels, nor fine coach, nor horses
came out of them. Instead snakes and toads
sprang forth, and all sorts of filth that covered
her up to her knees and bespattered her clothing.
</p>
<p>Rose shrieked and ran, and the snakes and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
toads pursued her, spitting venom, and the filth
rolled after her like a tide.
</p>
<p>She reached her mother&#8217;s house, and burst
open the door, and ran in, closing it behind her.
&#8220;Look what Blanche has brought on me,&#8221; she
sobbed. &#8220;This is all her fault.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The mother looked at her and saw the filth,
and she was so angry she would not listen to a
word Blanche said. She picked up a stick to
beat her, but Blanche ran away out of the house
and into the forest. She did not stop for her
clothes or her jewels or anything.
</p>
<p>She had not gone very far before she heard a
noise behind her. She looked over her shoulder,
and there was her golden coach rolling after her.
Blanche waited until it caught up to her, and
then she opened the door and stepped inside,
and there were all her diamonds and gold lying
in a heap. Her mother and Rose had not been
able to keep any of them.
</p>
<p>Blanche rode along for a long while, and then
she came to a grand castle, and the King and
Queen of the country lived there. The coach
drew up at the door, and every one came running
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
out to greet her. They thought she must
be some great Princess come to visit them,
but Blanche told them she was not a Princess,
but only the daughter of a poor widow, and
that all the fine things she had, had come out of
some eggs an old woman had given her.
</p>
<p>When the people heard this they were very
much surprised. They took her in to see the
King and Queen, and the King and Queen made
her welcome. She told them her story, and
they were so sorry for her they declared she
should live there with them always and be as a
daughter to them.
</p>
<p>So Blanche became a grand lady, and after
a while she was married to the Prince, the son of
the old King and Queen, and she was beloved
by all because she was so good and gentle.
</p>
<p>But when Blanche&#8217;s mother and sister heard
of the good fortune that had come to her, and
how she had become the bride of the Prince,
they were ready to burst with rage and spite.
Moreover they turned quite green with envy,
and green they may have remained to the end of
their lives, for all that I know to the contrary.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
<h2>THE FROG PRINCESS</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Russian Story</span></h3>
</div>

<p>There was once a Tsar<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> who had three sons,
and they were all dear to him, but the youngest,
Ivan, was the dearest of them all.
</p>
<p>When the Princes grew to manhood the Tsar
began to talk and talk to them about getting
married, but it so happened not one of the
Princes had ever seen the girl he wished to have
for a wife. There were many in the kingdom
whom they might well have loved, but not one
of them meant more to any of the Princes than
another.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, then,&#8221; said the Tsar at last,
&#8220;we will leave it to chance. Take your bows
and arrows and come with me into the courtyard.
You shall each shoot an arrow, and in
whatever places your arrows fall, there shall
you take your brides.&#8221;
</p>
<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>The Princes were not greatly pleased with
this plan, but still they dared not say no to
their father. They took their bows and went
with him into the courtyard.
</p>
<p>First the eldest son shot his arrow, and he
aimed it toward the east, where the sun rises.
The arrow fell upon the balcony of a great
nobleman&#8217;s house.
</p>
<p>Well and good! The nobleman had a daughter,
and she was so stately and handsome
that the Prince was very glad to take her
for a wife.
</p>
<p>Then the second Prince shot an arrow and
aimed it toward the west, where the sun is in its
glory. He was no less lucky than his brother,
for his arrow fell into the court of a rich merchant,
and he also had a daughter who was a
beauty. So the second son took her for a bride,
and he was well content.
</p>
<p>Last of all Prince Ivan shot his arrow, and he
aimed neither toward the east nor the west, but
straight up into the sky above him. Then a
sudden gust of wind arose and caught the arrow
and blew it away so that it fell in a great swamp.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
In this swamp were no rich nor beautiful ladies,
but only a poor, green, croaking frog.
</p>
<p>When the young Prince Ivan saw where his
arrow had fallen he was in despair. &#8220;How can
I marry a frog,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and have her rule
with me as my Princess?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a great pity,&#8221; said the Tsar; &#8220;nevertheless
what I have said I have said, and where
your arrow fell there must you take your bride.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Prince Ivan was married to the frog, and
the Tsar built a castle on the edge of the swamp
for them to live in.
</p>
<p>Now the Tsar was growing old, and he began
to consider in his mind to which of his sons he
would leave his kingdom. Gladly would he
have left it to his youngest son, who was his
favorite, but it did not seem right that a frog
should ever rule over the kingdom as Queen.
</p>
<p>At last he called the three Princes before
him and said, &#8220;My sons, to-morrow let your
wives bake me some soft white bread. I will
eat of it, and in this way I will know which of
you has the cleverest wife, and he who has the
cleverest wife shall inherit my kingdom.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>After they had heard him the three Princes
went away to their own homes, and Prince Ivan
was very sad.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What ails you, my dear husband,&#8221; said the
frog, &#8220;that you hang your head and are so
downcast?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is no wonder I am downcast,&#8221; answered
Prince Ivan. &#8220;My father has commanded that
you shall make him a loaf of soft white bread
to-morrow, and well I know that your webby
fingers can never make bread that he would
taste or even so much as look at.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not be too sure of that,&#8221; answered the
frog. &#8220;Sleep in peace, and I promise that to-morrow
I will provide a loaf that even the Tsar
will be glad to eat of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Prince did not believe this, but grief is
heavy, so no sooner was he in bed than he fell
into a deep sleep.
</p>
<p>Then the frog arose from beside him and went
into a far-off room and took off her frog-skin; for
she was really a Princess who had been enchanted.
She combed her hair and washed
herself and then she went out on the balcony of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
the castle and cried, &#8220;Nurses dear, nurses
dear, bring me a loaf of bread such as I used
to have in the palace of my own dear father,
the King.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After she had called this three times three
crows appeared, carrying among them a fine
napkin embroidered with gold, and in this napkin
was a loaf of bread. They laid the napkin
before the Princess and bowed three times,
croaking solemnly, and then they flew away
again into the night.
</p>
<p>The Princess took up the bread and went
back into the room and put on her frog-skin
again; after that she returned to her chamber
and lay down beside her husband.
</p>
<p>The next day when the Prince was ready to
set out for the Tsar&#8217;s palace, the frog brought
him the loaf of bread still wrapped in the napkin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take this, dear husband,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and
carry it to your father, the Tsar, but do not
open it on the way lest the dust should spoil
the fineness of the bread.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Prince took the loaf and rode away with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
it, but he could not forbear from peeping into
the napkin to see what was there, and what he
saw filled him with admiration and wonder.
Quickly he rode on his way, and soon reached
the Tsar&#8217;s palace.
</p>
<p>The two older brothers were there, and each
brought a loaf of fine white bread that his wife
had made.
</p>
<p>When Prince Ivan entered his brothers could
not forbear from smiling. &#8220;Come!&#8221; said they,
&#8220;show us quickly what kind of bread the Frog
Princess has made. Does it smell of reeds and
rushes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young Prince made no answer but gave
what he carried to his father.
</p>
<p>When the Tsar saw the fineness of the napkin
and the beautiful embroidery upon it he was
very much surprised. But he was still more
surprised when he opened the napkin and saw
what it contained. Never before had he seen
such bread. Not only was it soft and light
and fine, but it was molded along the sides in
cunning scenes, castles and cities, moats and
bridges, and upon the top was the imprint of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
the royal eagle, perfect even to the claws and
feathers.
</p>
<p>The Tsar could not admire it enough. Still
he was not willing to leave the kingdom to
Prince Ivan and so make a queen of a frog.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is very beautiful, but a loaf of bread is
soon eaten and forgotten,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I now
wish each one of you to bring me a carpet to
lay before my throne, and he who brings me the
finest carpet, him will I make my heir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Princes returned to their own homes, and
the youngest one was very sad and sorrowful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What ails you, my dear husband?&#8221; asked
the frog. &#8220;Why are you so downcast, and why
do you hang your head. Was not the Tsar
pleased with the bread you carried to him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was well pleased,&#8221; answered the Prince;
&#8220;but now he has commanded each one of us to
bring him a carpet, and to him who brings the
finest carpet he will leave his kingdom. No
wonder I am sad, for where, in this swamp, can
I find a carpet such as I require?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not trouble yourself about that,&#8221; answered
the frog. &#8220;Do you go and lie down and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
go quietly to sleep. I will supply you such a
carpet as you need.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Prince did not believe her, but because
grief is heavy he lay down and soon fell into a
deep sleep.
</p>
<p>Again as before the frog stole away to a distant
chamber and laid aside her frog-skin.
Then she went out on the balcony and cried
aloud three times; &#8220;Nurses dear, nurses true,
bring me a carpet such as lay before my bed in
my own home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At once the three crows appeared, carrying
among them a carpet rolled up and covered
with a piece of embroidered velvet. They laid
the roll before the Princess, bowed three times,
and then flew away again.
</p>
<p>The Princess carried the carpet back into the
chamber and put on her frog-skin again, and
then she went back and lay down quietly beside
the Prince.
</p>
<p>The next morning when the Prince was ready
to set out, the frog brought the roll of carpet
to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said she; &#8220;carry this to your father,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
but do not open it upon the way lest the dust
spoil its beauty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Prince took the carpet and rode away.
When he reached the Tsar&#8217;s palace his two
brothers were already there, and each had
brought with him a piece of carpet so fine and
rich that it was difficult to say which of the
two was the more beautiful.
</p>
<p>When the older brothers saw Ivan they began
to laugh. &#8220;Come!&#8221; said they. &#8220;Let us see
what kind of a carpet he has brought from his
swamp home. No doubt it is very wonderful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Prince laid the roll of carpet upon the floor
and opened it out and when they saw it every
one was struck with wonder. The elder Princes
had not a word to say. Never before had they
seen such a carpet. Not only was it as thick
and soft as eiderdown, but it shone with wondrous
colors that changed as one looked at them,
and it was embroidered with gold in strange
designs.
</p>
<p>The Tsar was filled with admiration. All
the same he still was unwilling to have a frog
reign in his kingdom.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is all very well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and never
before have I seen such a beautiful carpet. But
now I wish you all to appear before me to-morrow
with your wives. Let the Princesses
wear their most beautiful dresses and their
finest jewels, and whichever of you has the
wife best fitted to be Queen, to him will I leave
the kingdom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the Prince Ivan heard this he was in
despair. How could he ever bring the frog
to court and present her to the Tsar as though
she were a beautiful Princess?
</p>
<p>When he went home the frog at once asked
him why he was so sad and woebegone. &#8220;Is
not the kingdom to be yours?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered the Prince, &#8220;for now my
father, the Tsar, has demanded something else
of us.&#8221; He then told her how the Tsar had
bidden him and his brothers bring their wives
to court, and had said that whichever of the
Princesses was the finest and most beautiful
should reign as Queen, and her husband should
be the Tsar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not trouble over that,&#8221; said the frog.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
&#8220;Only go to bed and sleep quietly. The kingdom
shall still be yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the Prince went to bed, but he only
closed his eyes and pretended to go to sleep, for
he had grown very curious as to how the frog
had been able to provide him with the wonderful
loaf and the carpet.
</p>
<p>The frog kept very still until she thought the
Prince was asleep. Then she arose quietly from
his side and slipped away, but the Prince also
arose and followed her without her being aware
of it. She went to the far-off chamber, and
there she laid aside her frog-skin; and when
the prince saw her in her human form he was
amazed at her beauty, and his heart melted
within him for love of her, for her hair was like
spun gold, her eyes as blue as the sky, and her
skin as white as milk. Never had he seen such
a beauty.
</p>
<p>The Princess went out on a balcony as she
had before, and cried aloud three times, &#8220;Nurses
dear, nurses true, bring me fine clothes and jewels
to wear, richer than ever were seen before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At once the three crows appeared, carrying
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
with them jewels and fine robes all encrusted
with gems and embroidery. These they laid
at the Princess&#8217;s feet and bowed three times,
croaking hoarsely, and then they flew away.
</p>
<p>The Princess took the robes and jewels back
into the chamber to hide them, and while she
was doing this Prince Ivan returned to his bed
and lay down and closed his eyes as though he
were asleep. When the frog came back she
looked at him carefully, but he kept so still she
never guessed that he had stirred from where
he lay.
</p>
<p>The next morning the frog bade Ivan ride
away alone to the palace of the Tsar. &#8220;I will
follow you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and when you hear a
great noise, say, &#8216;That is my little Froggie, driving
up in her basket made of rushes.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Prince promised to do this and then he
rode away to the palace of the Tsar.
</p>
<p>His brothers were already there, and their
two wives were with them, both so handsome
and so magnificently dressed that each looked
finer than the other.
</p>
<p>When Ivan came in they all began to laugh.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
&#8220;Where is thy dear frog?&#8221; they asked. &#8220;Is she
still asleep among her reeds and rushes, or is
she too hoarse to come?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Even as they spoke there was a great noise
outside,&mdash;a roaring and rumbling like thunder.
</p>
<p>The palace shook until it seemed as though it
would fall about their ears. Every one was
terrified. Only Prince Ivan was calm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is my little Froggie now,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;she is driving up in her little basket of rushes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At once the noise ceased, the doors were flung
open, and a magnificent Princess swept into the
room. Never was such a beauty seen before.
Her golden hair fell almost to the floor and was
bound about with jewels. Her robes were stiff
with embroidery and gems. The other Princesses
paled before her as stars pale before the
rising moon.
</p>
<p>Prince Ivan took her by the hand and led her
to the Tsar. &#8220;This is my dear Princess,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;and surely it is she and she only who
should reign over this land.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Well, there were no two ways to that. The
Tsar could hardly contain himself for joy over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
the beauty of Prince Ivan&#8217;s bride. A great
feast was spread, and the Tsar himself led the
Princess to the table. She sat at his right
hand and drank from his jewelled cup, and
all was joy and merriment. Only the older
brothers and their wives were sad, for they
knew they had missed all chance of gaining the
kingdom.
</p>
<p>Now while they were still at the table, all
eating and drinking, Prince Ivan arose and
made some excuse for leaving the room. He
went quietly and mounted his horse and rode
back to his own castle.
</p>
<p>There he made haste to the room where his
wife had left her frog-skin. He hunted about
until he found it, and then he threw it into the
fire, for he did not intend that she should ever
hide herself away in it again.
</p>
<p>At once a clap of thunder sounded, and the
Princess stood before him. Her eyes were
streaming with tears, and she wrung her hands
in grief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Alas and woe is me!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Why did
you burn my frog-skin? A little longer, and I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
would have been free. Now I must go away
and leave you forever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But where are you going?&#8221; cried the Prince
in despair. &#8220;Wherever it is I will follow and
find you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Seek me beyond the seven mountains, beyond
the seven seas, in the kingdom of Koshchei
the Deathless, for it is in his house I will be,&#8221;
answered the Princess. Then she turned into
a great white swan and flew out through the
window and far, far away; so far the Prince
could no longer see her.
</p>
<p>Then Prince Ivan was filled with grief; and
he neither stayed nor tarried but set out at
once in search of his Princess.
</p>
<p>He journeyed on and journeyed on a short
way and a long way, and then he met an old
man with a grey beard that hung down far below
his belt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good day, good youth,&#8221; said the old man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good day, grandfather,&#8221; answered Ivan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whither do you journey with so sad a face?&#8221;
asked the stranger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I journey over land and over sea in search
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
of the kingdom of Koshchei the Deathless,&#8221;
answered Ivan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you have a long journey before you,&#8221;
said the old man. &#8220;But why do you seek the
kingdom of Koshchei the Deathless, that terrible
man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I seek it that I may find what is lost.&#8221;
Then Ivan told the old man his story, all about
his frog bride and how she had turned into a
Princess,&mdash;how he had burned the frog-skin
and how she had flown away as a swan, and that
now life would be nothing but a burden to him
until he could find her again.
</p>
<p>The old man shook his head. &#8220;Alas! alas!
You should never have burned the frog-skin!&#8221;
he said. He then told Ivan that the name of
the Princess was Vasilisa the Fair. &#8220;Her
mother was the sister of Koshchei the Deathless,&#8221;
said the stranger, &#8220;and when she was
born it was foretold that before she was eighteen
Koshchei should lose his life because of her.
It was for this reason that he changed her into
a frog and set her in the midst of the lonely
swamp. In a month and a day from now the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
Princess would have been eighteen, and the
danger to Koshchei would have been over.
Then he would have allowed her to lay aside
her frog-skin and take back her human shape.
But now he is angry and has carried her away
to his castle, and only by the grace of Heaven
will you be able to find her and set her free.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The old man then gave Prince Ivan a little
ball. &#8220;Take this,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and roll it before
you as you go. It will show you which way
to travel, and with its help you may reach the
kingdom of Koshchei.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ivan took the ball and thanked the old man
and journeyed on. He rolled the ball before
him, and in whichever direction it rolled he
followed.
</p>
<p>He went along and went along, until after
a while he came to a forest, and there he saw a
bear.
</p>
<p>Prince Ivan would have shot it, but the bear
cried to him, &#8220;Do not shoot me, Prince. Take
me with you as a servant, and the time may
come when I can help you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the Prince. &#8220;Come with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
me&#8221;; so he journeyed on with the bear at his
heels.
</p>
<p>Presently he saw a wild duck and would have
shot it, but the duck called to him, &#8220;Do not
shoot me, dear Prince. Take me with you, and
I will be a faithful servant. The time may
come when you will need me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; answered the Prince. &#8220;You
also may come with us as a companion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So the Prince journeyed along with the bear
at his heels and the duck flying overhead.
</p>
<p>After a while they came to the edge of a river,
and there lay a great fish, gasping out its life in
the sunlight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now at last I shall have a good meal,&#8221;
said the Prince.
</p>
<p>But the fish cried to him in a human voice,
&#8220;Throw me back into the river, Prince, that I
may live. The time may come when I can do
you a good turn also.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So the Prince had mercy on the fish and
threw it back into the water.
</p>
<p>After that he and his companions traveled on
a long way. They journeyed over seven mountains
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
and crossed seven seas, and so they came
at last to the kingdom of Koshchei the Deathless.
</p>
<p>There the Prince saw a little hut. It stood
on hen&#8217;s legs and turned this way and that,
whichever way the wind blew. There was no
getting at the door. Then the Prince cried,
&#8220;Little hut, stand the way my mother built
you with your back away from me and your
door before me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At once the hut whirled round and stood
with the open door in front of him.
</p>
<p>Prince Ivan entered in, and saw a bony-legged
Baba Yaga lying on the stove with her grey hair
over her face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you? And what seek you here in
the kingdom of Koshchei the Deathless?&#8221; she
cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not ask questions but rise up and give
me food and drink,&#8221; said the Prince; &#8220;for I
am both hungry and thirsty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Baba Yaga arose and served him food
and drink. He ate and gave part to the bear
and the duck. Then he told the Baba Yaga
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
why he had come there&mdash;that he was wandering
in search of his dear wife, Vasilisa the
Fair.
</p>
<p>The old witch shook her head. &#8220;It will be a
hard thing to rescue her,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Koshchei
is very powerful. Only in one way can you
overcome him. Not far from here stands a tree.
It is as hard as rock, so that no ax can dent it,
and so smooth that none can climb it. On the
top of it is a nest. In the nest is an egg. A
duck sits over the egg to guard it. In that egg
is a needle, and only with that needle can you
kill Koshchei the Deathless.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Baba Yaga then led Prince Ivan to the
door and pointed out to him where the tree
grew, and Prince Ivan hurried on toward it,
with his two faithful servants, the bear and the
duck.
</p>
<p>But when he reached the tree he looked at it
with despair. It was indeed very smooth and
high,&mdash;as smooth as glass, and when he tried
his hunting knife upon it the knife bent and
crumpled in his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Master, now is the time that I can help
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
you,&#8221; said the bear. He went to the tree
and clasped it and shook it, so that its roots
cracked, and it fell with a mighty noise.
</p>
<p>At once the duck that was guarding the egg
caught it up in its claws and flew away with it.
But Ivan&#8217;s duck pursued so fiercely that the
other was forced to drop the egg in order to
defend itself.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately they had both flown over a
river, and into this river the egg dropped and
was lost to sight.
</p>
<p>Ivan sat down upon the bank of the river and
wept. &#8220;Alas, alas!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Now truly is
my dear wife lost to me, for never can I recover
the egg from the river.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hardly had he spoken when the fish he had
thrown back into the river appeared, bearing
the egg in its mouth.
</p>
<p>Now Ivan&#8217;s grief was turned to rejoicing.
He broke the egg and took out the needle.
Then, with the little ball to lead him, he soon
made his way to Koshchei&#8217;s palace.
</p>
<p>The Deathless One rushed out to meet him,
but Ivan attacked him with the point of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
needle. It was in vain Koshchei tried to protect
himself. Ivan drove the needle into him
deeper and deeper, and presently Koshchei sank
down dead before him, no better than a lump
of clay.
</p>
<p>Prince Ivan strode across him and on into
the castle. From room to room he went, and in
the deepest dungeon he found the Princess
Vasilisa, his own dear wife. She threw herself
into his arms, weeping with joy.
</p>
<p>Then they went to Koshchei&#8217;s treasure room
and took from it all the most precious jewels,&mdash;all
that the faithful bear could carry they
loaded upon his back and carried away with
them.
</p>
<p>After that they journeyed back to their own
kingdom, and if any one was glad to see them
it was the Tsar himself.
</p>
<p>He built for them a castle close to his own,
where they could not even see the swamp.
There Ivan and his frog princess lived in the
greatest love and happiness, and after the old
Tsar&#8217;s death they themselves ruled over the
kingdom as the Tsar and Tsaritsa.

<h2>THE MAGIC TURBAN, THE MAGIC SWORD<br />AND THE MAGIC CARPET</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Persian Story</span></h3>
</div>

<p>There were once two brothers, the sons of a
rich merchant, and when he died he left all his
estate to be divided between them equally.
This was done, and the elder at once set about
trading and improving his condition, so that very
soon he became twice as rich as he had been.
</p>
<p>But the younger son had no luck. Everything
he undertook failed. Moreover, he never
had the heart to say no to a friend in need.
So before long he was left with not a penny in
his purse or a roof over his head.
</p>
<p>In his distress he went to his elder brother
and asked help of him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How is this?&#8221; said the elder. &#8220;Our father
left the same to both of us, and I have prospered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
in the world and have now become a rich
man, but you have not even a roof to shelter
your head or a bite to eat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a long tale,&#8221; said the younger,
&#8220;and what is done is done. But give me another
chance, and it may be that this time I will
succeed in the world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After they had talked a long time the elder
brother consented to give him fifty dollars, but
if he wasted that the way he had the rest of his
property, he was not to come back again.
</p>
<p>The younger brother took the money and
went off with it, but it was not long before it
had slipped through his fingers just the way his
other money had. Before long he was back at
his brother&#8217;s door, asking for help again.
</p>
<p>The older brother scolded and reproached
him. He was a spendthrift and a waster.
But in the end he gave him another fifty dollars,
and bade him be off, and not dare to return
again.
</p>
<p>The younger brother went off with the fifty
dollars and this time he was sure he would succeed
with it. But his luck was still no better
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
than it had been before. Soon it was all gone,
and back he came to his brother&#8217;s house.
</p>
<p>So it went on. The older brother could not
rid himself of him. At last the elder brother,
seeing there would be no peace for him as long
as he remained where he was, made up his
mind to sell all his possessions and take the
money and journey to a far land without telling
his younger brother anything about it.
</p>
<p>This he did, but somehow or other the
younger one got wind of it. He found what
ship his brother was to sail on, and then he
crawled aboard at night, when nobody was
watching, and hid himself among the cargo.
</p>
<p>The next day the ship set sail. Soon they
were out at sea. Then the elder brother came
out on deck and strutted up and down, and he
rejoiced at heart that he had shaken off the
younger lad and with good luck might never see
him again.
</p>
<p>But just as he thought this, whom should he
see but the lad coming across the deck to meet
him and give him greeting.
</p>
<p>The elder was a sick and sorry man. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
seemed there was no ridding himself of his
brother. At the first port they touched he left
the ship, and his brother got off with him, for
he had no idea of being left behind.
</p>
<p>The elder brother stood there on the shore
and looked about him. Then he said, &#8220;Listen,
now! It is a long way to the town. Do you
stay here while I go on farther, beyond yon
spit of land, and see whether I can find a dwelling
where I can buy us a couple of horses; for
I have no wish to journey on foot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The younger brother was for going along too,
but to this the elder would not consent. No,
no; the lad was to stay there and watch a box
that the elder brother had brought along. (The
box had nothing in it, but this the younger
brother did not know.)
</p>
<p>So the elder brother set out and soon was out
of sight, and the younger one sat on the box
and kicked his heels and waited, and waited and
waited and waited; but his brother never did
come back.
</p>
<p>Then the lad knew the older one had made a
fool of him. He looked in the box and found
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
it empty. So off he set to see whether he could
make his own way in the world and no thanks
to any one.
</p>
<p>He journeyed on a short way and a long way,
and so he came to a place where three men were
quarreling together fiercely, and the things they
were quarreling over were an old turban, a
piece of carpet, and a sword.
</p>
<p>As soon as they saw the lad they stopped
quarreling and ran and caught hold of him.
&#8220;You shall decide! You shall decide!&#8221; they
shouted all together.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it you wish me to decide?&#8221; asked
the lad.
</p>
<p>Then the men told him they were three
brothers, and that when their father died he had
left them these three things,&mdash;the turban, the
carpet, and the sword. Whoever placed the
turban on his head would at once become invisible.
Whoever sat on the carpet had only to
wish himself wherever he would be, and the
carpet would carry him there in a twinkling,
and the sword would cut through anything,
and no magic could stand against it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;These things should belong to me, because
I am the eldest,&#8221; cried one of the men.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I should have them because I am the
strongest and stoutest,&#8221; said the second.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am the youngest and weakest and
need them most,&#8221; cried the third. They then
began to quarrel again and even came to blows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop, stop,&#8221; cried the lad. &#8220;You said that
I should decide this matter for you, so why
quarrel about it? But before I decide I must
try the things and see whether what you have
told me is really so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>To this the brothers agreed. First they gave
him the sword, and the lad took it in his hand
and aimed a blow at a rock near by, and the
sword cut through the rock as smoothly and
easily as though it had been a piece of cheese.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now give me the turban,&#8221; said the lad.
</p>
<p>The brothers gave him the turban, and he
placed it upon his head and at once became invisible!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now the carpet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The brothers spread out the carpet on the
ground, and the lad seated himself upon it with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
the turban still upon his head and the sword in
his hand! Then he wished himself far away in
some place where the brothers would never find
him.
</p>
<p>Immediately he found himself in the outskirts
of a large city. He stepped from the carpet
and rolled it up and took the turban from
his head and looked about him. He had no
idea of going back to return the things to the
brothers, and if they waited for him they waited
a long time. &#8220;It will teach them not to quarrel
but to live at peace with each other,&#8221; said
the lad to himself. Then he made his way to
the nearest house, for he was hungry and meant
to ask for a bite to eat.
</p>
<p>He knocked, and an old woman opened the
door, and she was so old that her chin and her
nose met.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good day, mother,&#8221; said the lad.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good day to you,&#8221; answered the crone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you give me a bite to eat, for the love
of charity?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Yes, the crone would do that. She gave him
a bite and a sup and a bit over, and while he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
was eating and drinking she sat and talked with
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the news here in the city?&#8221; asked
the lad.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh the same news as ever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what is that? For I am a stranger
here and know no more of yesterday or the
week before than of to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will tell you. Over yonder lies the
castle, and the King lives there. He has only
one daughter, and she is a beauty, you may
believe. Every night the Princess disappears
from the castle, and where she goes no one can
tell but herself, and she will not. So the King
has offered a reward to any one who will find
out. The half of his kingdom he offers and the
hand of the Princess as well, if only any one
can tell him where she goes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a good hearing,&#8221; said the lad. &#8220;I
have a mind to try for that prize myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but wait a bit,&#8221; said the old woman.
&#8220;There is another side to the story, for if you
try and fail your head will be lifted from your
shoulders with a sharp sword, and you are too
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
fine a young man to lose your life in that
way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the lad was determined to try. In vain
the old woman warned and entreated him. He
thanked her for the meal he had eaten, and
then off he set for the palace. There he told
the errand that had brought him and after that
it did not take long for him to get to see the King.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you think you can find out where the
Princess goes at night,&#8221; said the King.
</p>
<p>Yes, the lad thought he could.
</p>
<p>Very well, then, he might have a try at it,
but he must remember that if he tried and failed
his head would be cut from his shoulders with
a sharp sword.
</p>
<p>Yes, the lad understood that, and he was
ready to take the risk.
</p>
<p>So that night he was taken to the door of a
room in a high tower, and the room was of iron
and had only one door and one window. Into
this room the Princess was put every night,
and it would be the duty of the lad to watch at
the door and see either that she did not leave
it, or where she went.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>Presently the Princess came upstairs and
passed by the lad without so much as a glance,
but his heart leaped within him, she was so
beautiful.
</p>
<p>She opened the door to go in, and the lad put
on his turban of darkness and slipped in after
her, but the Princess did not know that because
he was invisible. She closed the door tight and
sighed three times, and then a great black demon
stood before her, and he was terrible to
look upon, he was so huge and ugly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear Lala,&#8221; said the Princess, &#8220;let
us be off at once. I do not know why, but I
feel so frightened, just as though some misfortune
were about to come upon me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is nonsense,&#8221; said the demon. &#8220;But
do you seat yourself upon my head, and we will
be off at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The demon wore a buckler upon his head,
and now he stooped, and she seated herself upon
it, but the lad was quick and sprang up and
took his place beside her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ai! Ai!&#8221; cried the demon, &#8220;but you are
heavy to-day, Princess.&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
<a name='linki_4' id='linki_4'></a>
<img src='images/c003.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
Then the demon flew out through the window and away<br />
through the night.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I do not know what you mean,&#8221; answered
the Princess. &#8220;I am no heavier and no lighter
than I was last night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the demon flew out through the window
and away through the night so fast that
the lad had much ado to keep from falling off.
</p>
<p>After a while they came to a garden the like
of which the lad had never seen before and
never expected to see again, for the leaves of
the trees were of silver, and the branches
were of gold, and the fruits were emeralds
and rubies.
</p>
<p>As they passed through it the lad stretched
out his hand and broke off a twig and put it in
his bosom. Then all the trees in the garden
began to sigh and moan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Child of man! Child
of man! why do you break and torture us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Princess shuddered. &#8220;Some one besides
ourselves is here in the garden,&#8221; she cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That cannot be, or we would see him,&#8221;
answered the demon, but he was frightened
and flew on faster than before.
</p>
<p>Presently they came to another garden and
it was even more wonderful than the first,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
for here the trees were of diamonds, and the
fruits of every kind of precious stones you can
think of.
</p>
<p>As they passed through it the lad stretched
out his hand and broke off a twig. Then all
the trees began to sigh and moan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Child of man! Child of man! Why do you
break and torture us?&#8221; they cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear Lala, what did I tell you?&#8221;
asked the Princess. &#8220;I am afraid&#8221;; and she
trembled all over her body.
</p>
<p>The demon answered nothing, but he flew on
even faster than ever.
</p>
<p>Soon after they came to a magnificent palace,
and the demon flew in through a window and
alighted. Then the Princess and the lad leaped
down from the buckler, and the demon was
glad to have the weight off him. After that he
vanished.
</p>
<p>The Princess opened a door and went into
another room, with the lad close behind her,
and there was the King of all the demons, and
he was so huge and black that the demon Lala
was nothing to him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My dearest dear one, why are you so late
to-night?&#8221; asked he of the Princess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know what was the matter,&#8221; answered
the fair one, &#8220;but something is terribly
wrong&#8221;; and she told him all that had happened.
</p>
<p>The Demon laughed at her. &#8220;You are nervous,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;But come! You have not
kissed me yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He came close to the Princess to kiss her, but
the lad stepped between them and gave the
Demon such a push that he almost fell over;
at the same time he himself gave the Princess a
kiss upon the cheek.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you push me away?&#8221; cried the
Demon, and he was very angry.
</p>
<p>The Princess began to tremble again. &#8220;I
did not push you,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Moreover, some
one kissed me on the cheek. I am sure somebody
is in the room with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The King Demon looked all around, but he
could see nobody. Then he called a slave to
bring the Princess the jeweled slippers she always
wore when she came to his palace.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>The slave brought the slippers on a golden
cushion, and they were crusted over with pearls
and precious stones. He knelt before the Princess,
and she took one and put it on, but at the
same time the lad took the other and slipped it
in his bosom. The Princess and the Demon
did not know what had become of it. They
hunted everywhere, but they could not find it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, now! See how careless you are,&#8221;
said the Demon; and he bade the slave bring
another pair of slippers.
</p>
<p>This the slave did, but it was the same with
this pair as with the others. While the Princess
was putting on one slipper the lad took
the other and hid it in his bosom. The Princess
and the Demon and the slave all looked
for it, but they could not find it.
</p>
<p>At that the Princess flew into a passion and
threw both the slippers away from her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not care,&#8221; said she; &#8220;and now I will
not wear any slippers at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind!&#8221; answered the Demon. &#8220;We
will have a sherbet together, and after that we
will eat.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>He clapped his hands, and another slave appeared,
bearing two crystal goblets full of sherbet.
The Princess took one goblet and the
Demon the other. Just as they were about to
drink the lad smote the crystal goblet from the
Princess&#8217;s hand so that it fell upon the marble
floor and was shattered, and all the sherbet was
spilled.
</p>
<p>The lad picked up a splinter of the crystal
and hid it in his bosom with the golden twig,
the diamond twig, and the two slippers. But
the Princess shook and trembled until she could
hardly stand, and even the Demon was troubled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you cast the goblet on the floor?&#8221;
he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not,&#8221; answered the Princess, &#8220;but
some one struck it from my hand&#8221;; and she
began to weep.
</p>
<p>The Demon comforted her and bade other
slaves bring in the feast that had been prepared
for him and the Princess.
</p>
<p>Quickly the slaves brought it and placed it
before them. The lad had never seen such a
feast. All the dishes were of gold and were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
carved to represent scenes in demon life, and the
handles were set thick with precious stones and
enamelled in strange colors. There were all
sorts of delicious things to eat, so that the lad&#8217;s
mouth watered at the smell of them.
</p>
<p>The Demon and the Princess sat down to eat,
but it was small good the Princess got of the
feast, for every time the Demon put anything
on her plate the lad snatched it away and ate
it, and the Princess was left hungry. The lad
also took one of the golden forks and one of the
golden spoons and hid them in his bosom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did I tell you,&#8221; cried the Princess.
&#8220;Something is wrong! Something is <i>terribly</i>
wrong.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I can see that myself,&#8221; said the King
Demon. &#8220;You had better go on home again,
for we will get no pleasure out of this night,
and that I can easily see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lala was called, the Princess mounted the
buckler in haste, and away the Demon flew
with her. But this time the lad did not fly
with them.
</p>
<p>He waited until they were gone, and then he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
drew the Sword of Sharpness and smote the
King Demon&#8217;s head from his shoulders.
</p>
<p>At once a clap of thunder sounded; the castle
rocked, and the walls crumbled about him.
The trees in the gardens were withered, and a
thick darkness fell, while all about him sounded
cries and groans.
</p>
<p>But the lad seated himself upon the carpet
and wished himself back at the door of the
room in the tower, and there he was in a twinkling,
long before Lala had flown in through the
window with the Princess, even though he
flew as swiftly as the wind.
</p>
<p>The lad took off the Turban of Darkness,
and rolled up the carpet, and lay down and
closed his eyes as though he were asleep.
</p>
<p>Presently the Princess opened the door and
peered out. There lay the lad, snoring and
with his eyes closed. The Princess drew a
sharp needle and ran it into the lad&#8217;s heel, but
he never flinched, so she felt sure he was
asleep.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou fool!&#8221; said she scornfully. &#8220;Sleep
on, and to-morrow thou shalt pay the penalty.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>Then she went back into the room and closed
the door.
</p>
<p>The next day the Princess called the guards
and bade them carry the lad away and cut the
head from his shoulders.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a bit,&#8221; said the lad. &#8220;Do not be in
such a hurry. First we must appear before
thy father the King; he must decide in this
case, and it may be I have something to tell
him that will be worth the hearing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Princess could not refuse this, so she and
the lad were brought before the King, and the
lad began to tell his story. When he came to
the part where the great black Demon had
come and flown away with the Princess she
turned first as red as blood and then as pale as
death.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not true!&#8221; she cried, but the King
bade her be silent.
</p>
<p>Then the lad told how they had flown
through the gardens. &#8220;It is all a wicked lie,&#8221;
moaned the Princess, but the lad drew forth
the twigs he had broken from the trees and
showed them to the King as proof of his truth.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>After that the lad told of how they had
entered the castle, and how the King Demon
had tried to kiss the Princess, and of the shattered
goblet and the uneaten feast, and he had
the splinter of crystal and the spoon and fork
to show, so the King knew it was all true, and
the Princess looked as though she wished she
were dead.
</p>
<p>Last of all he told how the Princess had returned
on the Demon&#8217;s buckler, and how he had
remained behind and cut off the King Demon&#8217;s
head, and how the castle had fallen and the
gardens had withered, and all had become darkness
and confusion.
</p>
<p>When the Princess heard this she gave a
shriek of joy. &#8220;Then you have saved me!&#8221;
she cried. &#8220;Never again need I fly forth at
night at the will of the Demon nor be his slave!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then it was her turn to tell her story. She
told how one time the King Demon had seen
her walking in the palace gardens and had fallen
in love with her, and how he had used his magic
to gain power over her. She told how she hated
him and feared him, but how against her will
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
he had forced her to come to visit him every
night in his castle and had sent the demon
Lala to fetch her. But now that the King
Demon was dead, she was free, and it was the
lad who had saved her.
</p>
<p>When the King, her father, heard this, he
marveled greatly. Glad was he that such a
brave lad was to be his son-in-law, for that was
his promise. The lad and the Princess were
betrothed then and there, and the King gave
orders that a grand wedding feast should be
prepared, for they were to be married as soon
as possible. All the good folks far and near
were invited to come to the feast.
</p>
<p>The lad&#8217;s elder brother was invited with the
rest, but he never dreamed that the brave lad
who was to marry the Princess was his own
younger brother.
</p>
<p>He came to the palace on the feast day and
took his place at the table with the other guests,
and then he looked up at the three thrones
where the King and the Princess and the lad
were sitting, and there it was his own younger
brother who sat there.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>When the man saw that he was afraid, for he
remembered how he had deserted the lad on
the seashore to live or die as fate willed, and
he feared he might be punished for it.
</p>
<p>But the younger brother bore him no grudge,
but was grateful to him for what he had done.
As soon as he saw the elder one there among the
guests, he sent a servant for him and placed
him in the seat of honor and called him brother.
</p>
<p>So all was happiness and rejoicing. Everybody
was happy, but the lad and the Princess
were happiest of all, because they loved each
other and had just been married.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
<h2>THE THREE SILVER CITRONS</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Persian Story</span></h3>
</div>

<p>There was once a King who had three sons,
and he loved them all equally, one no more than
the other.
</p>
<p>When he had grown old and felt his strength
leaving him, he called the three Princes before
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My sons,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I am no longer young,
and soon the time will come when I must leave
you. I have it in mind to give the kingdom
to one or the other of you now and not to leave
it for you to quarrel over after I have gone.
You have reached a time of life when you
should marry. Go forth into the world and
seek, each one of you, a bride for himself. He
who brings home the most beautiful Princess
shall have the kingdom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The three Princes were well content with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
what their father said. At once the two elder
ones made ready to set out; but the youngest
one said he would wait a bit. &#8220;It is not
right,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that our father should be left
alone in his old age. I will wait until my
brothers return, and then I too will start out to
try my fortune in the world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That was good hearing for the older Princes,
for they had always been a bit jealous of their
younger brother and were just as well pleased
not to have him with them.
</p>
<p>Before they set out they packed a bag full of
food to carry with them, for they had no wish
to starve by the wayside. They took baked
meats and boiled meats, and little cakes and
big cakes, and fine white bread, and wine to
drink.
</p>
<p>Well, off they set, and on they went, a short
way and a long way, until they came to the
edge of a forest, and there they sat down in
the shade to eat; and when they spread the
food out before them it made a fine feast I can
tell you.
</p>
<p>Just as they were about to begin an old
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
woman came hobbling out of the forest. She
was so old that her nose and her chin met and
she was so bent that she could barely get
along even with the help of the crutch she had.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good masters, give me a bite and a sup,
I beg of you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is a hundred years
since I have tasted anything but black bread.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have lived on black bread that long
you can live on it a little longer,&#8221; said one
of the Princes, and then they both laughed.
However, they bade the old crone come back
there after they had gone, and it might be she
would find some broken bits lying round, and
those she might have if she cared to gather
them up.
</p>
<p>Then the Princes went on eating and drinking,
and after they had finished they journeyed
on again.
</p>
<p>Presently they came to a cross roads, and
there they separated; one went east and one
went west. The eldest Prince took the east
road, and soon it brought him to a castle, and
in this castle lived a Princess who was as pretty
as a picture. It was not long before the Prince
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
won her to be his wife, for he was a stout and
comely lad, and as soon as they were married
he set out for home, taking his bride with him.
</p>
<p>As it happened with the eldest Prince, so it
did with the second brother. He also found a
castle and a Princess, and won her to be his
bride, and brought her home with him to his
father&#8217;s house; and when the two Princesses
met it was hard to choose between them, they
were both so pretty. It seemed as though the
kingdom would have to be divided between the
elder brothers and their pretty brides.
</p>
<p>But first it was only right that the youngest
Prince should have a chance, so now that his
brothers had returned he was ready to set out
into the wide world and see what sort of a
beauty he could pick up. His brothers laughed
at him, for they had never had much of an
opinion of his wit, even though they were jealous
of him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only see that she has two eyes and a stout
pair of hands,&#8221; said they. &#8220;Our Princesses will
find something for her to do about the palace,
no doubt, and as for you, you shall always have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
a warm place in the chimney corner where you
can sit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The youngest Prince answered never a word,
but he put some food in a scrip and off he set.
</p>
<p>He journeyed on and on, a short way and a
long way, and then he too came to the forest
and sat down in the shade to eat, as his brothers
had done before him.
</p>
<p>Presently the old crone came hobbling out
from the forest, and she was more bent and
hideous than ever.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good youth, give me a bite and sup, I
beg of you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is a hundred years
since I have tasted anything but black bread.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it is high time you had something
else to eat,&#8221; said the Prince, and he gave her
the best of all he had, both food and wine.
</p>
<p>The old woman ate and drank, and by the
time she finished there was little enough left for
the Prince. Then she drew out from her sleeve
a pretty little pipe and gave it to him. &#8220;Take
this,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and if there is anything you
wish for play a tune upon the pipe, and it may
help you to find it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>After that she disappeared into the forest again.
</p>
<p>The Prince hung his scrip over his shoulder,
and then he was ready to set out, but first he
thought he might as well see what the pipe was
good for. He set it to his lips and blew a tune.
</p>
<p>Immediately a score of little black Trolls with
long noses appeared before him. &#8220;Master,
here we are!&#8221; they cried. &#8220;What would you
have of us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not know I was your master,&#8221; thought
the Prince, but what he said was, &#8220;What I want
is the prettiest Princess in twelve kingdoms for
a bride, and if you can get me such a one I&#8217;ll
thank you kindly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We know where to find such a Princess,
and we can show you the way,&#8221; said the oldest
and blackest of the Trolls, &#8220;but we ourselves
cannot touch her. You will have to win her for
yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Well, that suited the Prince, and if they
would only show him the Princess he would do his
best to get her. So off they set, and presently
they came to a high mountain, and it belonged
to the King of the Trolls. The Prince blew
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
upon the pipe again, and the mountain opened
before him. He went in, and there he was in a
great chamber, where the Troll kept the three
daughters of three Kings whom he had taken
captive and brought there, and they were so
beautiful that their beauty lighted the whole
place so there was no need of lamps.
</p>
<p>When the girls saw the Prince they were terrified
and began to run about this way and
that, looking for a place to hide; but they
could find no place, for the chamber was
quite smooth and bare. Then they changed
themselves into three silver citrons and rolled
about this way and that, all over the room.
</p>
<p>The Prince was terribly distressed that the
girls had changed into citrons, for they were so
lovely that he would have been glad to have
any one of them for a wife.
</p>
<p>However, he took up the citrons and hid
them in his bosom, and then, as there seemed
nothing better to do, he set out for home again,
for after having seen three such beauties as that
he would never be satisfied with any one else.
</p>
<p>After a while as he journeyed he came to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
wood where he had seen the old crone before,
and there she was, waiting for him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, and did you get what you set out to
search for?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did and I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; answered the Prince;&mdash;and
then he told her the whole story and showed
her the three citrons that he still carried in his
bosom. &#8220;They are three beauties, I can tell
you,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but of what use are they as
long as they remain as citrons?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may be able to help you again,&#8221; said the
old hag. She then gave him a silver knife and
a little golden cup. &#8220;Keep the citrons until
you come to a running stream. Then take
one,&mdash;whichever one you please,&mdash;and cut it
open with this knife. At once one of the Princesses
will appear. She will ask you for a
drink of water. Give it to her immediately in
this golden cup, and after that she will remain
with you and you can have her for your wife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Prince was delighted. He took the knife
and cup and thanked the old woman gratefully,
and then she again disappeared in the shadow
of the forest.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>The Prince journeyed on until he came to a
running stream, and it was not so very far from
his father&#8217;s palace. Then he got out the knife
and the cup and one of the citrons. He cut
the citron, and at once one of the Princesses
appeared before him. If she had looked a
beauty when he saw her in the mountain she
was ten times lovelier, now that he saw her
in the light of day. The Prince could only
gape and gape at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me a cup of water to drink,&#8221; demanded
the Princess; but the Prince was so
busy staring at her that he did not move, and
in a moment the Princess vanished from before
him, and where she went he could not tell.
He was filled with grief over the loss of her,
but she was gone, and that was all of it.
</p>
<p>Then the Prince took out the second citron.
&#8220;This time I will be ready for her,&#8221; he thought.
He took his knife and cut the second citron.
At once the second Princess appeared before
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me a cup of water to drink,&#8221; she demanded.
But again the Prince was so overcome
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
by her beauty that he could no more move
than if he had been rooted to the ground, and
the next moment she too disappeared from before
his eyes.
</p>
<p>The Prince was in despair. He ran this way
and that way, calling aloud and trying to find
her, but she had vanished like the fading of a
breath.
</p>
<p>And now there was only one other citron
left, and the Prince trembled at the thought
of opening it, for he was afraid he would lose
this third Princess as he had the others. At
last he drew it from his bosom and prepared to
cut it, but first he filled the golden cup and set
it ready to his hand. Then he seized the knife
and with one stroke divided the citron in two.
</p>
<p>At once the third Princess stood before him,
and though the others had been beautiful she
exceeded them in beauty as the full moon exceeds
the stars in splendor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me a cup of water,&#8221; said she; and
this time the Prince was ready. Almost before
she could speak he had caught up the golden
cup and presented it to her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>The Princess took the cup and drank, and
then she smiled upon him so brightly that he
was dazzled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I am yours, and you are mine,&#8221; said
she, &#8220;and where you go I will follow, for I have
no one in all the wide world but you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Prince was almost wild with happiness.
He kissed her hands and looked with joy upon
her face.
</p>
<p>But she was dressed only in a linen shift.
</p>
<p>The Prince took off his cloak and wrapped it
about her. &#8220;Climb up into a tree,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;and hide yourself among the branches, and I
will go to the castle and bring you from thence
robes and jewels and all things fitting for such
a beautiful Princess to wear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>To this the Princess agreed. The Prince
helped her to climb up among the branches of
a tree that overhung the water, and then he
hastened away to the castle.
</p>
<p>The beauty sat there among the leaves waiting
for his return, and the time of waiting was
long, for when the Prince reached the castle he
was obliged to stay and tell the whole story to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
his father before the King would permit him
to return with the robes and jewels he had
promised to bring to his bride.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_5' id='linki_5'></a>
<img src='images/c004.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
The Princess took the cup and drank.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile an ugly kitchen wench who
worked in the castle came to fetch water from
the spring, for every day the Princesses required
it for their baths. The girl had brought with
her an earthen jar to hold the water.
</p>
<p>As she leaned over the stream to fill the jar
she looked down into the water and saw the
face of the Princess reflected there, as she peered
out from the leaves above.
</p>
<p>The servant wench, whose name was Lucy,
thought it was the reflection of her own face
that she saw. She gazed upon it with wonder
and joy. &#8220;Ah! Ah!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;What a
beauty I am; why did no one ever tell me so?
Not even the two Princesses are as beautiful
as I.&#8221; She knelt there, staring and staring at
the reflection. Then in a rage she sprang to
her feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And they send me to draw water for them!
Me, who ought to sit on a throne above them
all. But I&#8217;ll no longer be their slave. I&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
break their water jar to pieces, and if they
send me with others I&#8217;ll break them too!&#8221;
</p>
<p>With that she threw down the jar with such
violence that it was broken into bits, and
then she stamped about with rage.
</p>
<p>The sight amused the Princess so that she
laughed aloud. The servant wench looked up
and saw the lovely face peering out at her from
among the green leaves; it was the same beautiful
face she had seen reflected in the water.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you? What are you doing up there
among the leaves?&#8221; she asked in a thick voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am the promised bride of the Prince who
has just gone up to the castle,&#8221; answered the
beauty. &#8220;He has gone to fetch fine robes and
jewels that I may dress myself properly before
I appear before his father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When she said this an evil thought came into
the servant wench&#8217;s head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come down,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and I will dress
your hair for you; I have often done this for
the other Princesses, and I can arrange it so
that you will look even more beautiful when
the Prince returns.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>The Princess was nothing loath. She had no
thought of evil. She climbed down from the
tree and sat herself upon a rock, while Lucy
looped and pinned her hair in place and wove
a crown of flowers to place upon it. &#8220;Come
now, and see how beautiful you are,&#8221; said the
servant.
</p>
<p>She led the Princess to the place where the
stream was deepest, and then, when the beauty
stooped to look at herself in the water, Lucy
pushed her in. After that she stripped herself
to her shift, and hid her clothes under a
rock, and climbed up into the tree. There she
sat among the leaves, peering out just as the
Princess had done.
</p>
<p>Presently the Prince returned, bringing with
him all sorts of beautiful clothes and gifts for
his Princess bride. What was his amazement
to see, instead of the beauty he left in the tree,
the ugly face of the servant wench smiling down
at him from among the leaves.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing there?&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;And what have you done with the Princess?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Alas,&#8221; said the servant maid, pretending to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
weep, &#8220;I am the Princess. After you left me
a wicked enchantress came by this way and
changed me into this shape.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Prince was filled with grief and horror
at these words. However, he believed her and
could not find it in his heart to punish her for
a misfortune she could not help. He showed
her the robes and jewels he had brought, and the
servant wench made haste to come down and
dress herself in them. When she had done this
she looked more hideous than ever. The Prince
could hardly bear to look at her, his grief and
shame were so great. Nevertheless he took her
by the hand and led her back to the castle.
</p>
<p>There the King was waiting full of impatience
to see the bride of his youngest son, this most
beautiful Princess in all of twelve kingdoms.
But when the Prince brought the ugly servant
wench before him he could hardly believe his
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This a beauty!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Are you a fool
or do you take me for one? It is an insult
to bring me such a creature for a daughter-in-law.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>The older Princes and their brides did not try
to hide their scorn or laughter, but the servant
sank on her knees, weeping, and repeated to the
king the same story she had told the Prince.
She assured him that she had been as beautiful
as the day when she had climbed up into
the tree and would be so still if the wicked
enchantress had not passed by and bewitched
her.
</p>
<p>The King frowned and stroked his beard.
&#8220;Yours is a sad case,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and since the
Prince has given his word to marry you, marry
you he must. Perchance sometime your beauty
may return.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He then gave orders that Lucy should be
shown to the apartments prepared for the Princess
and that she should be waited on and
served just as though she were the beauty his
son had promised him.
</p>
<p>But the heart of the Prince was like a stone
in his bosom, and he could not bear to look
upon the ugly one who was to be his bride.
</p>
<p>Now when the Princess had been pushed into
the water she had not been drowned, as Lucy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
thought. Instead she changed into a beautiful
silver fish that swam about in the stream or hid
under a grassy bank.
</p>
<p>Now there was another servant who came
down to the stream for water instead of Lucy,
and one day when this servant dipped the jar
into the water the fish swam into it, and she
carried it back to the castle with her.
</p>
<p>It was so pretty that she showed it to the
Prince, hoping it might cheer him for a moment.
</p>
<p>No sooner had the Prince looked upon the
fish than he grew quite light and happy. He
would not let the servant take the fish away but
kept it with him in a crystal bowl and now
he no longer grieved so bitterly about his
bride.
</p>
<p>Lucy did not know why the Prince had grown
happier. She thought perhaps he had begun
to love her. But when she found that he
scarcely ever came to see her, but spent all
his time watching the fish, she became very
angry.
</p>
<p>She bribed a servant to steal the fish from
the Prince&#8217;s room and bring it to her. Then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
she had a fire built and threw the fish into it to
burn.
</p>
<p>No sooner did the flames touch the fish, however,
than it changed into a beautiful silver bird
and flew out of the window.
</p>
<p>The false Princess was frightened. &#8220;There is
some magic here,&#8221; thought she, &#8220;and magic
that will prove my ruin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And now the silver bird sat on a branch outside
the Princess&#8217;s window and sang and sang.
The Prince heard it, and his heart was filled
with joy, he knew not why, and he forgot the
fish that had disappeared from the bowl.
</p>
<p>Lucy also heard it and was more frightened
than ever. She sent for the servant who had
stolen the fish and bribed him to set a net to
catch the bird. This he did one day when the
Prince was away, and then he brought the bird
to the false Princess. But she shuddered at
sight of it as though she were cold, and bade
him take it outside and wring its neck.
</p>
<p>This the servant was loath to do, but he dared
not disobey her. He carried the bird outside
and did as she commanded, and three drops of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
blood fell on the ground just below the Prince&#8217;s
window.
</p>
<p>The next morning when the Prince awoke he
saw with amazement that a beautiful citron tree
was growing outside of his window. Its trunk
was silver, and its leaves were silver, and on the
branch nearest his window hung three silver
citrons, and they were exactly like the silver
citrons he had brought from the Troll&#8217;s home
under the mountain.
</p>
<p>The Prince saw them hanging there, and his
heart was filled with joy and hope as he looked
at them. He reached out and plucked them
and hid them in his bosom. Then he took the
silver knife and the golden cup and hastened
down to the stream where he had opened the
citrons before.
</p>
<p>He cut the first citron, and at once the first
Princess appeared and asked him for a drink
of water, but he scarcely looked at her, and she
fled away.
</p>
<p>He cut the second citron, and the second
Princess appeared and demanded water, but
he never stirred, and she too vanished.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>Then he filled the golden cup with water and
with a trembling hand cut the third citron.
</p>
<p>Immediately the third Princess appeared.
&#8220;Give me of the water to drink,&#8221; said she.
</p>
<p>At once the Prince handed her the golden cup.
She drank deeply, and then she smiled upon
him, and it was his own dear love who stood before
him more beautiful than ever.
</p>
<p>The Prince could hardly believe in his good
fortune. But the Princess told him all that had
happened to her&mdash;how Lucy had pushed her
into the water, and how she had been changed
first into a fish, and then into a bird, and then
into a citron as she had been before. The
Prince could not wonder and marvel enough.
He took her by the hand and led her up to the
castle, and her golden hair fell all about her so
that she seemed to be clothed in a shimmering
golden mantle.
</p>
<p>When she appeared before the King he was
amazed at the beauty of her, and when the
Prince told him that this was his true bride and
not the other, his happiness knew no bounds.
The whole palace resounded with rejoicings.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
Only Lucy was so terrified that she ran and
jumped out of a window and broke her neck.
</p>
<p>But the kingdom was given to the youngest
Prince, and he and the Princess reigned there
in peace and happiness as long as they lived.

<h2>THE MAGIC PIPE</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Norse Tale</span></h3>
</div>

<p>There was once three brothers, all the sons
of the same father and mother.
</p>
<p>The two elder were hard-working, thrifty lads,
who had no care except as to how they might
better themselves in the world. But the youngest,
whose name was Boots, was not thrifty at
all. He was a do-nothing and was quite content
to sit in the chimney corner and warm his
shins and think about things.
</p>
<p>One day the eldest son came to his father and
said, &#8220;I have it in mind to go over yonder to
the King&#8217;s castle and take service there, for I
hear the King has need of a herdsman to take
care of his hares for him. The wages are six
dollars a week, and if any one can keep the herd
together and bring them safe home every night
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
without losing one of them the King will give
him the Princess for a wife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The father was pleased when he heard this.
Six dollars a week was fair pay, and it would be
a fine thing if the lad could win the Princess
for his wife. At any rate it was worth trying
for.
</p>
<p>So the eldest son cocked his hat over one ear,
and off he set for the palace.
</p>
<p>He had not gone so very far when he came to
the edge of a forest, and there was an old crone
with a green nose a yard long, and it was caught
in a crack of a log. She was dancing and hopping
about, but for all her dancing and hopping
she got no farther than that one spot, for her
nose held her there.
</p>
<p>The lad stopped and stared at her, and she
looked so funny to his mind that he laughed and
laughed till his sides ached.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You gawk!&#8221; screamed the old hag. &#8220;Come
and drive a wedge in the crack so I can get my
nose out. Here I have stood for twice a hundred
years, and no Christian soul has come to
set me free.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you have stood there twice a hundred
years you might as well stay a while longer.
As for me, I&#8217;m expected at the King&#8217;s palace,
and I have no time to waste driving wedges,&#8221;
said the lad, and away he went, one foot before
the other, leaving the old crone with her nose
still in the crack.
</p>
<p>When the lad came to the palace, he knocked
at the door and told the man who opened it
that he had come to see about the place of
herdsman. When the man heard this he
brought the lad straight to the King, and told
him what the lad had come for.
</p>
<p>The King listened and nodded his head.
Yes, he was in need of a herdsman and would
be glad to take the lad into his service, and
the wages were just as the youth thought,
with a chance of winning the Princess to
boot. But there was one part of the bargain
that had been left out. If the lad failed to
keep the herd together and lost so much
as even one small leveret, he was to receive
such a beating as would turn him black
and blue.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>That part of the bargain was not such pleasant
hearing as the rest of it. Still the lad had
a mind to try for the Princess. So he was
taken out to the paddock where the hares were,
and a pretty sight it was to see them hopping
and frisking about, hundreds and hundreds of
them, big and little.
</p>
<p>All morning the hares were kept there in the
paddock with the new herdsman watching them,
and as long as that was the case everything
went well. But later on the hares had to be
driven out on the hills for a run and a bite of
fresh grass, and then the trouble began. The
lad could no more keep them together than if
they had been sparks from a fire. Away they
sped, some one way and some another, into the
woods and over the hills,&mdash;there was no keeping
track of them. The lad shouted and ran
and ran and shouted till the sweat poured down
his face, but he could not herd them back. By
the time evening came he had scarce a score of
them to drive home to the palace.
</p>
<p>And there on the steps stood the King with a
stout rod in his hands, all ready to give the lad
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
a beating. And a good beating it was, I can
tell you. When the King had finished with him
he could hardly stand. Home he went with
only his sore bones for wages.
</p>
<p>Then it was the second brother&#8217;s turn. He
also had a mind to try his hand at keeping the
King&#8217;s hares, with the chance of winning the
Princess for a wife. Off he set along the same
road his brother had taken, and after a while
he came to the place where the old crone was
dancing about with her long, green nose still
caught in the crack of a log. He was just as
fond of a good laugh as his brother was, and he
stood for a while to watch her, for he thought it
a merry sight. He laughed and laughed till the
tears ran down his cheeks, and the old hag was
screaming with rage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You gawk! Come and drive a wedge into
the crack so that I can get my nose out,&#8221; she
bawled. &#8220;Here I have been for twice a hundred
years and no Christian soul has come to set
me free.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have been there that long it will not
hurt to stay a bit longer,&#8221; said the youth.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;m no woodsman, and besides that I&#8217;m on
my way to the King&#8217;s palace to win a Princess
for a wife.&#8221; And away he went, leaving the
old woman screaming after him.
</p>
<p>After a while the second brother came to the
palace, and when the servants heard why he had
come they were not slow in bringing him before
the King. Yes, the King was as much in need
of a herdsman for his hares as ever, but was the
lad willing to run the risk of having only a
beating for his pains?
</p>
<p>Yes, the lad was willing to run that risk,
for he was almost sure he could keep the
herd together, and it was not every day
one had a chance of winning a Princess for
a wife.
</p>
<p>So they took him out to the paddock where
the hares were. All morning he herded them
there as his brother had done before him, and
that was an easy task. But it was in the afternoon
that the trouble began. For no sooner
did the fresh wind of the hillside ruffle up their
fur than away they fled, this way and that,
kicking up their heels behind them. It was in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
vain the lad chased after them and shouted and
sweated; he could not keep them together.
In the end he had scarcely threescore of them
to drive back to the palace in the evening.
</p>
<p>And the King was waiting for him with a
cudgel in his hands, and if the lad did not get
a good drubbing that day, then nobody ever
did. When the King finished with him he was
black and blue from his head to his heels, and
that is all he got for trying to win a Princess for
a wife.
</p>
<p>Now after the second son had come home
again with his doleful tale, Boots sat and
thought and thought about what had happened.
After a while, however, he rose up and shook
the ashes from his clothes and said that now it
was his turn to have a try at winning the Princess
for his wife.
</p>
<p>When the elder brothers heard that they
scoffed and hooted. Boots was no better than
a numskull anyway, and how could he hope
to succeed where they had failed.
</p>
<p>Well, all that might be true or it might not,
but at any rate he was for having a try at this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
business, so off he set, just as the other two had
before him.
</p>
<p>After a while he came to the log where his
brothers had seen the hag with her nose caught
in the crack, and there she was still, for no one
had come by in the meantime to set her free.
He stood and stared and stared, for it was a
curious sight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you gawk! Why do you stand there
staring?&#8221; cried the old hag. &#8220;Here I have
been for twice a hundred years, and no Christian
soul will take the trouble to set me free. Drive
a wedge into the crack so that I may get my
nose out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That I will and gladly, good mother,&#8221; said
the youth. &#8220;Two hundred years is a long time
for one to have one&#8217;s nose pinched in a crack.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Quickly he found a wedge and drove it into
the crack with a stone, and then the old hag
pulled her nose out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you have done me a good turn, and I
have it in mind to do the same for you,&#8221; she
said. With that she took a pretty little pipe
out of the pocket of her skirt. &#8220;Do you take
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
this,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and it will come in handy if
you&#8217;re on your way to the King&#8217;s palace. If
you blow on the right end of the whistle the
things around you will be blown every which way
as if a strong wind had struck them, and if you
blow on the wrong end of it they will be gathered
together again. And those are not the
only tricks the pipe has, for if any one takes it
from you, you have only to wish for it, and
you can wish it back into your fingers again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Boots took the pipe and thanked the old hag
kindly, and then he bade her good-by and went
on his way to the King&#8217;s palace.
</p>
<p>When the King heard what Boots had come
for, he was no less ready to take him for a herdsman
than he had been to take his brothers.
&#8220;But, mind you, you shall have a drubbing that
will make your bones ache if you come back in
the evening with even the smallest leveret missing
from the herd,&#8221; said the King.
</p>
<p>Yes, that was all right. The lad was ready
to take the risk, so all morning Boots herded
the hares in the paddock, and in the afternoon
he took them out to the hills, as the bargain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
was. There the hares could no longer be kept
in a herd. They kicked up their heels and away
they went, every which way.
</p>
<p>So that was the game, was it? Boots was
very willing to play it, too. <a name='tune' id='tune'></a>He took out his
pipe and blew a tune on the right end of it,
and away the hares flew faster than they had
intended, as though a strong wind had blown
them. Presently there was not one left on the
hill. Then the lad lay down in the sun and fell
asleep.
</p>
<p>When he awoke it was toward evening and
time to be bringing the hares back to the castle,
but not one of them was in sight.
</p>
<p>Then Boots sat up, and shook the hair out of
his eyes and blew on the wrong end of the
pipe. Immediately there was the whole herd
before him, drawn up in ranks just like soldiers.
Not even one of the smallest leverets was
missing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is well,&#8221; said Boots. &#8220;And now we&#8217;ll
be going home again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Off he set for the palace, driving the hares
before him, and as soon as he came near enough
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
he could see the King standing on the steps
waiting for him with a stout cudgel in his hand,&mdash;for
he had no thought but that Boots would
fail in his task.
</p>
<p>When he saw the whole herd come hopping
home, as tame as sheep, and turning into the
paddock, he could hardly believe his eyes. He
hurried after and began to count them. He
counted them over and over again, and not
one was missing.
</p>
<p>Well, Boots had brought them all back safely
that time, but the question was whether he
could do it again.
</p>
<p>Boots thought he could. Indeed, he was sure
he could. So the next afternoon he set out for
the hills, whistling merrily as he tramped along
with the hares hopping before him.
</p>
<p>That day things happened just as they had
before. As soon as the hares began to stray
Boots took his pipe and blew them away as
though they were so much chaff. He lay down
and slept until it was time to take them home
again, and then he blew them together with the
wrong end of the pipe.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>When the King found the lad had brought
the whole herd home again for the second time
he was greatly troubled, for he had no mind to
give the Princess to Boots for a bride. So the
third day he bade the Princess go out to the
hills and hide herself among the bushes and
watch and see how it was that Boots managed
to keep the hares together.
</p>
<p>This the Princess did. She hid back of the
bushes; she saw Boots come tramping up the
hill with the hares frisking before him; she saw
him blow them away with his pipe as though
they had been so many dry leaves in the wind,
and then, after he had had a nap, she saw
him blow them together again.
</p>
<p>Then the Princess must and would have that
pipe. She came out from the bushes and
offered to buy it. She offered ten dollars for
it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifty!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A hundred!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Boots had no wish to sell, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
as it was the Princess, and as she seemed
so set and determined on having it, he would
tell her what he would do; he would sell the
pipe for a hundred dollars if she would give
him a kiss for every dollar she paid.
</p>
<p>The Princess did not know what to say to
that. It was not becoming that a Princess
should kiss a herdsman; still she wanted the
pipe and as that was the only way to get it she
at last agreed. She paid the lad a hundred
bright silver dollars, and she also gave him a
hundred kisses out there on the hillside, with
no one to look on but the hares.
</p>
<p>Then she took the pipe and hastened home
with it.
</p>
<p>But small good the pipe did her. Just as she
reached the palace steps the pipe slipped out
of her fingers as though it had been buttered,
and look as she might she could not find it
again.
</p>
<p>That was because the lad had wished it back
to himself. At that very moment he was on
his way home with the pipe in his pocket and
the hares hopping before him in lines like soldiers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>When the King heard the story he thought
and pondered. The Princess had told him
nothing of the kisses. He thought she had
bought the pipe for a hundred dollars, so the
next day he sent the Queen out to the hillside
with two hundred dollars in her pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Princess is young and foolish,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;She must have lost the pipe on the hillside,
and no doubt the lad has it back by this time.
Do you go out and see if you can buy it from
him and if you once have your fingers on it
you&#8217;ll not lose it, I&#8217;ll wager.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So the Queen went out to the hillside and hid
herself in the bushes, and she saw Boots blow
the hares away and lie down to sleep and afterward
blow them together again in a twinkling.
</p>
<p>Then she came out from the bushes and
offered to buy the pipe. At first the lad said
no, and again no, and then no for the third
time, but in the end he sold the pipe to the
Queen for two hundred dollars and fifty kisses
to go with them, and the Queen hoped the King
would never hear of it. She took the pipe
and hastened home with it, but she fared no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
better than the Princess, for just before she
reached the palace the pipe disappeared from
her fingers, and what had become of it she did
not know.
</p>
<p>When the King heard that he was a wroth
and angry man. Now he himself would go out
to the hill and buy the pipe, for there was no
trusting the womenfolk. If he once had the
pipe in his hands there would be no losing it again,
and of that he felt very sure. So he mounted
his old mare Whitey and rode over to the hillside.
There he hid himself among the bushes,
and he hid old Whitey there with him, and he
watched until he had seen all that the others
had told him about. Then he came out and
tried to strike a bargain with the lad. But this
time it seemed as though Boots would not sell
the pipe,&mdash;neither for love nor money. The
King offered him three hundred dollars, and four
hundred dollars, and five hundred dollars for it,
and still Boots said no.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; said Boots suddenly. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll
go over there in the bushes and kiss old Whitey
on the mouth five-and-twenty times, I&#8217;ll sell
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
you the pipe for five hundred dollars, but not
otherwise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That was a thing the King was loath to do,
for it ill befitted a king to kiss an old horse, but
have the pipe he must and would; and besides
there was nobody there to see him do it but
Boots, and he did not count. &#8220;May I spread a
handkerchief between old Whitey&#8217;s mouth and
mine before I do it?&#8221; asked the King.
</p>
<p>Yes, he might do that.
</p>
<p>So the King went back into the bushes and
spread his handkerchief over old Whitey&#8217;s
mouth and kissed her through it five-and-twenty
times. Then he came back and the lad gave
him the pipe, and the King mounted and rode
away with it, and he was well pleased with
himself for his cleverness, and he held the pipe
tight in one hand and the bridle in the other.
&#8220;No danger of my losing it as the Queen and
the Princess did,&#8221; thought he. But scarcely
had the King reached the palace steps when the
pipe slipped through his fingers like water, and
what became of it he did not know.
</p>
<p>But when Boots drove the hares home that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
evening he had the pipe safely hidden away up
his sleeve, though nobody knew it.
</p>
<p>And now how about the Princess? Would
the King keep his promise and give her to the
herdsman for a wife?
</p>
<p>But that was a thing the King and Queen
could not bear to think of.
</p>
<p>They put their heads together and talked
and talked, and the more they talked the more
unwilling they were to have a herdsman in the
family. So in the end this is what they said.
The Princess was a very clever girl, and she
must have a clever lad for a husband. If
Boots could tell bigger stories than the Princess
then he should have her for a wife, but if she
could tell bigger stories than he, then he should
have three red strips cut from his back and be
beaten all the way home.
</p>
<p>To this Boots agreed.
</p>
<p>Then the Princess began. &#8220;I looked out of
my window,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and there was a tree
that grew straight up to the sky, and the fruit
of it was diamonds and pearls and rubies. I
reached out and picked them and made myself
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
such a necklace as never was, and I might
have it yet only I leaned over the well to look
at myself in the waters, and the necklace fell
off, and there it lies still at the bottom of the
well for any one who cares to dive for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a pretty story!&#8221; said Boots; &#8220;but
I can tell a better. When I was herding hares
the Princess came up on the hill and gave me a
hundred bright silver dollars and a hundred
kisses as well, one for every dollar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the King scowled till his brows met,
and the Princess grew as red as fire. &#8220;Oh,
what a story!&#8221; cried she.
</p>
<p>Then it was her turn again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I went to see my god-mother, and she took
me for a ride in a golden coach drawn by six
fleas, and the fleas were as big as horses, and
they went so fast we were back again a day before
we started.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good story,&#8221; said Boots, &#8220;but
here&#8217;s a better. The Queen came out on the
hillside and made me a present of two hundred
dollars, and she kissed me over and over
again; fifty kisses she gave me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is that true?&#8221; said the King to the Queen;
and his face was as black as thunder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great wicked story,&#8221; cried the Queen,
&#8220;and you must know it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the Princess tried again. &#8220;I had six
suitors, and I cared for one no more than another,
but the seventh one was a demon, and
he would have had me whether or no. He
would have flown away with me before this,
but I caught his tail in the crack of the door,
and he howled most horribly. There he is still,
if you care to look, unless he has vanished in a
puff of smoke.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now it is my turn,&#8221; said Boots, &#8220;and you
may believe this or not, but it&#8217;s mostly true.
The King came up on the hillside and kissed the
old white mare twenty-five times. I was there
and I saw. He kissed her twenty-five times,
and he gave me five hundred dollars not to tell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When Boots told this right out before every
one, the King was so ashamed he did not know
which way to look. &#8220;There&#8217;s not a word of it
true. It&#8217;s the biggest story I ever heard,&#8221;
said he.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, then I have won the Princess,&#8221;
said Boots. &#8220;And when shall we be married?&#8221;
</p>
<p>And married they were that day week, for
the King and Queen could no longer refuse to
give Boots the Princess for a wife.
</p>
<p>The Princess was willing, too, for Boots was
a handsome, fine-looking lad. They had a great
feast at the wedding, with plenty of cake and
ale flowing like water. I was there, and I ate
and drank with the best of them.
</p>
<p>Pfst! There goes a mouse. Catch it and
you may make a fine big cloak of its skin,&mdash;and
that&#8217;s a story, too.

<h2>THE TRIUMPH OF TRUTH</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Hindu Story</span></h3>
</div>

<p>There was once a Rajah who was both
young and handsome, and yet he had never
married. One time this Rajah, whose name
was Chundun, found himself obliged to make
a long journey. He took with him attendants
and horsemen, and also his Wuzeer. This
Wuzeer was a very wise man,&mdash;so wise that
nothing was hid from him.
</p>
<p>In a certain far-off part of the kingdom the
Rajah saw a fine garden, and so beautiful was
it that he stopped to admire it. He was surprised
to see growing in the midst of it a small
bingal tree that bore a number of fine bingals,
but not a single leaf.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a very curious thing, and I do not
understand it,&#8221; said Chundun Rajah to his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
Wuzeer. &#8220;Why does this tree bear such fine and
perfect fruit, and yet it has not a single leaf?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could tell you the meaning,&#8221; said the
Wuzeer, &#8220;but I fear that if I did you would not
believe me and would have me punished for
telling a lie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That could never be,&#8221; answered the Rajah;
&#8220;I know you to be a very truthful man and wise
above all others. Whatever you tell me I shall
believe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then this is the meaning of it,&#8221; said the
Wuzeer. &#8220;The gardener who has charge of
this garden has one daughter; her name is
Guzra Bai, and she is very beautiful. If you
will count the bingals you will find there are
twenty-and-one. Whosoever marries the gardener&#8217;s
daughter will have twenty and one children,&mdash;twenty
boys and one girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Chundun Rajah was very much surprised
at what his Wuzeer said. &#8220;I should like to
see this Guzra Bai,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can very easily see her,&#8221; answered the
Wuzeer. &#8220;Early every morning she comes into
the garden to play among the flowers. If you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
come here early and hide you can see her without
frightening her, as you would do if you went to
her home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Rajah was pleased with this suggestion,
and early the next morning he came to the
garden and hid himself behind a flowering bush.
It was not long before he saw the girl playing
about among the flowers, and she was so very
beautiful the Rajah at once fell in love with
her. He determined to make her his Ranee,
but he did not speak to her or show himself
to her then for fear of frightening her. He
determined to go to the gardener&#8217;s house
that evening and tell him he wished his daughter
for a wife.
</p>
<p>As he had determined, so he did. That very
evening, accompanied only by his Wuzeer, he
went to the gardener&#8217;s house and knocked upon
the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is there?&#8221; asked the gardener from
within.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is I, the Rajah,&#8221; answered Chundun.
&#8220;Open the door, for I wish to speak with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The gardener laughed. &#8220;That is a likely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
story,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Why should the Rajah come
to my poor hut? No, no; you are some one
who wishes to play a trick on me, but you shall
not succeed. I will not let you in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is indeed Chundun Rajah,&#8221; called
the Wuzeer. &#8220;Open the door that he may
speak with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the gardener heard the Wuzeer&#8217;s voice
he came and opened the door a crack, but still
he only half believed what was told him. What
was his amazement to see that it was indeed
the Rajah who stood there in all his magnificence
with his Wuzeer beside him. The poor
man was terrified, fearing Chundun would be
angry, but the Rajah spoke to him graciously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not be afraid,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Call thy
daughter that I may speak with her, for it is
she whom I wish to see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl was hiding (for she was afraid) and
would not come until her father took her hand
and drew her forward.
</p>
<p>When the Rajah saw her now, this second
time, she seemed to him even more beautiful
than at first. He was filled with joy and wonder.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now I will tell you why I have come here,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I wish to take Guzra Bai for my
wife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At first the gardener would not believe him,
but when he found the Rajah did indeed mean
what he said he turned to his daughter. &#8220;If
the girl is willing you shall have her,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;but I will not force her to marry even a
Rajah.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl was still afraid, yet she could not
but love the Rajah, so handsome was he, and
so kind and gracious was his manner. She gave
her consent, and the gardener was overjoyed at
the honor that had come to him and his daughter.
</p>
<p>Chundun and the beautiful Guzra Bai were
married soon after in the gardener&#8217;s house, and
then the Rajah and his new Ranee rode away
together.
</p>
<p>Now Chundun Rajah&#8217;s mother, the old
Ranee, was of a very proud and jealous nature.
When she found her son had married a common
girl, the daughter of a gardener, and that
Chundun thought of nothing but his bride and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
her beauty, she was very angry. She determined
to rid herself of Guzra Bai in some way
or other. But Chundun watched over his
young Ranee so carefully that for a long time
the old Queen could find no chance to harm
her.
</p>
<p>But after a while the Rajah found it was
again necessary for him to go on a long journey.
Just before he set out he gave Guzra Bai a little
golden bell. &#8220;If any danger should threaten
or harm befall you, ring this bell,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Wherever I am I shall hear it and be with
you at once, even though I return from the
farthest part of my kingdom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>No sooner had he gone than Guzra Bai began
to wonder whether indeed it were possible that
he could hear the bell at any distance and return
to her. She wondered and wondered until
at last her curiosity grew so great that she
could not forbear from ringing it.
</p>
<p>No sooner had it sounded than the Rajah
stood before her. &#8220;What has happened?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;Why did you call me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing has happened,&#8221; answered Guzra
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
Bai, &#8220;but it did not seem to me possible that
you could really hear the bell so far away, and
I could not forbear from trying it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the Rajah. &#8220;Now you
know that it is true, so do not call me again
unless you have need of me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again he went away, and Guzra Bai sat and
thought and thought about the golden bell.
At last she rang it again. At once the Rajah
stood before her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear husband, please to forgive me,&#8221;
cried Guzra Bai. &#8220;It seemed so wonderful I
thought I must have dreamed that the bell
could bring you back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Guzra Bai, do not be so foolish,&#8221; said her
husband. &#8220;I will forgive you this time, but
do not call me again unless you have need of
me.&#8221; And he went away.
</p>
<p>Again and for the third time Guzra Bai rang
the bell, and the Rajah appeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you call me again?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;Is it again for nothing, or has something happened
to you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing has happened,&#8221; answered Guzra
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
Bai, &#8220;only somehow I felt so frightened that I
wanted you near me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Guzra Bai, I am away on affairs of state,&#8221;
said the Rajah. &#8220;If you call me in this way
when you have no need of me, I shall soon
refuse to answer the bell. Remember this and
do not call me again without reason.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And for the third time the Rajah went away
and left her.
</p>
<p>Soon after this the young Ranee had twenty
and one beautiful children, twenty sons and one
daughter.
</p>
<p>When the old Queen heard of this she was
more jealous than ever. &#8220;When the Rajah
returns and sees all these children,&#8221; she thought
to herself, &#8220;he will be so delighted that he will
love Guzra Bai more dearly than ever, and
nothing I can do will ever separate them.&#8221;
She then began to plan within herself as to
how she could get rid of the children before
the Rajah&#8217;s return.
</p>
<p>She sent for the nurse who had charge of the
babies, and who was as wicked as herself. &#8220;If
you can rid me of these children, I will give you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
a lac of gold pieces,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Only it must
be done in such a way that the Rajah will lay
all the blame on Guzra Bai.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That can be done,&#8221; answered the nurse.
&#8220;I will throw the children out on the ash heaps,
where they will soon perish, and I will put
stones in their places. Then when the Rajah
returns we will tell him Guzra Bai is a wicked
sorceress, who has changed her children into
stones.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The old Ranee was pleased with this plan
and said that she herself would go with the
nurse and see that it was carried out.
</p>
<p>Guzra Bai looked from her window and saw
the old Queen coming with the nurse, and at
once she was afraid. She was sure they intended
some harm to her or the children. She
seized the golden bell and rang and rang it,
but Chundun did not come. She had called
him back so often for no reason at all that
this time he did not believe she really needed
him.
</p>
<p>The nurse and the old Ranee carried away
the children, as they had planned, and threw
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
them on the ash heaps and brought twenty-one
large stones that they put in their places.
</p>
<p>When Chundun Rajah returned from his journey
the old Ranee met him, weeping and tearing
her hair. &#8220;Alas! alas!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Why
did you marry a sorceress and bring such terrible
misfortune upon us all!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What misfortune?&#8221; asked the Rajah.
&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His mother then told him that while he was
away Guzra Bai had had twenty-one beautiful
children, but she had turned them all into
stones.
</p>
<p>Chundun Rajah was thunderstruck. He
called the wicked nurse and questioned her.
She repeated what the old Ranee had already
told him and also showed him the stones.
</p>
<p>Then the Rajah believed them. He still
loved Guzra Bai too much to put her to death,
but he had her imprisoned in a high tower, and
would not see her nor speak with her.
</p>
<p>But meanwhile the little children who had
been thrown out on the ash heap were being
well taken care of. A large rat, of the kind
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
called Bandicote, had heard them crying and
had taken pity on them. She drew them down
into her hole, which was close by and where
they would be safe. She then called twenty of
her friends together. She told them who the
children were and where she had found them,
and the twenty agreed to help her take care of
the little ones. Each rat was to have the care
of one of the little boys and to bring him suitable
food, and the old Bandicote who had found
them would care for the little girl.
</p>
<p>This was done, and so well were the children
fed that they grew rapidly. Before long they
were large enough to leave the rat hole and go
out to play among the ash heaps, but at night
they always returned to the hole. The old
Bandicote warned them that if they saw anyone
coming they must at once hide in the hole,
and under no circumstances must any one see
them.
</p>
<p>The little boys were always careful to do this,
but the little girl was very curious. Now it so happened
that one day the wicked nurse came past
the ash heaps. The little boys saw her coming
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
and ran back into the hole to hide. But the
little girl lingered until the nurse was quite close
to her before she ran away.
</p>
<p>The nurse went to the old Ranee, and said,
&#8220;Do you know, I believe those children are still
alive? I believe they are living in a rat hole
near the ash heap, for I saw a pretty little girl
playing there among the ashes, and when I
came close to her she ran down into the largest
rat hole and hid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Ranee was very much troubled when she
heard this, for if it were true, as she thought
it might be, she feared the Rajah would hear
about it and inquire into the matter. &#8220;What
shall I do?&#8221; she asked the nurse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Send out and have the ground dug over and
filled in,&#8221; the nurse replied. &#8220;In this way, if
any of the children are hidden there, they will
be covered over and smothered, and you will
also kill the rats that have been harboring
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Ranee at once sent for workmen and
bade them go out to the rat holes and dig and
fill them in, and the children and the rats would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
certainly have been smothered just as the nurse
had planned, only luckily the old mother rat
was hiding near by and overheard what was
said. She at once hastened home and told her
friends what was going to happen, and they
all made their escape before the workmen arrived.
She also took the children out of the
hole and hid them under the steps that led
down into an old unused well. There were
twenty-one steps, and she hid one child under
each step. She told them not to utter a sound
whatever happened, and then she and her friends
ran away and left them.
</p>
<p>Presently the workmen came with their tools
and began to fill in the rat holes. The little
daughter of the head workman had come with
him, and while he and his fellows were at work
the little girl amused herself by running up and
down the steps into the well. Every time she
trod upon a step it pinched the child who lay
under it. The little boys made no sound when
they were pinched, but lay as still as stones,
but every time the child trod on the step under
which the Princess lay she sighed, and the third
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
time she felt the pinch she cried out, &#8220;Have pity
on me and tread more lightly. I too am a
little girl like you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The workman&#8217;s daughter was very much
frightened when she heard the voice. She ran
to her father and told him the steps had spoken
to her.
</p>
<p>The workman thought this a strange thing.
He at once went to the old Ranee and told her
he dared no longer work near the well, for he
believed a witch or a demon lived there under
the steps; and he repeated what his little
daughter had told him.
</p>
<p>The wicked nurse was with the Ranee when
the workman came to her. As soon as he had
gone, the nurse said: &#8220;I am sure some of those
children must still be alive. They must have
escaped from the rat holes and be hiding under
the steps. If we send out there we will probably
find them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Ranee was frightened at the thought
they might still be alive. She ordered some
servants to come with her, and she and the
nurse went out to look for the children.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>But when the little girl had cried out the little
boys were afraid some harm might follow, and
prayed that they might be changed into trees,
so that if any one came to search for them
they might not find them.
</p>
<p>Their prayers were answered. The twenty
little boys were changed into twenty little banyan
trees that stood in a circle, and the little
girl was changed into a rose-bush that stood in
the midst of the circle and was full of red and
white roses.
</p>
<p>The old Ranee and the nurse and the servants
came to the well and searched under every
step, but no one was there, so went away again.
</p>
<p>All might now have been well, but the workman&#8217;s
mischievous little daughter chanced to
come by that way again. At once she espied
the banyan trees and the rose-bush. &#8220;It is a
curious thing that I never saw these trees before,&#8221;
she thought. &#8220;I will gather a bunch of
roses.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She ran past the banyan trees without giving
them a thought and began to break the flowers
from the rose-tree. At once a shiver ran through
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
the tree, and it cried to her in a pitiful voice:
&#8220;Oh! oh! you are hurting me. Do not break
my branches, I pray of you. I am a little girl,
too, and can suffer just as you might.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The child ran back to her father and caught
him by the hand. &#8220;Oh, I am frightened!&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;I went to gather some roses from the
rose-tree, and it spoke to me;&#8221; and she told
him what the rose-tree had said.
</p>
<p>At once the workman went off and repeated
to the Ranee what his little daughter had told
him, and the Queen gave him a piece of gold
and sent him away, bidding him keep what he
had heard a secret.
</p>
<p>Then she called the wicked nurse to her and
repeated the workman&#8217;s story. &#8220;What had we
better do now?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My advice is that you give orders to have
all the trees cut down and burned,&#8221; said the
nurse. &#8220;In this way you will rid yourself of
the children altogether.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This advice seemed good to the Ranee. She
sent men and had the trees cut down and
thrown in a heap to burn.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>But heaven had pity on the children, and
just as the men were about to set fire to the
heap a heavy rain storm arose and put out the
fire. Then the river rose over its banks, and
swept the little trees down on its flood, far, far
away to a jungle where no one lived. Here
they were washed ashore and at once took on
their real shapes again.
</p>
<p>The children lived there in the jungle safely
for twelve years, and the brothers grew up tall
and straight and handsome, and the sister was
like the new moon in her beauty, so slim and
white and shining was she.
</p>
<p>The brothers wove a hut of branches to
shelter their sister, and every day ten of them
went out hunting in the forest, and ten of them
stayed at home to care for her. But one day
it chanced they all wished to go hunting together,
so they put their sister up in a high
tree where she would be safe from the beasts
of the forest, and then they went away and left
her there alone.
</p>
<p>The twenty brothers went on and on through
the jungle, farther than they had ever gone before,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
and so came at last to an open space
among the trees, and there was a hut.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who can be living here?&#8221; said one of the
brothers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us knock and see,&#8221; cried another.
</p>
<p>The Princes knocked at the door and immediately
it was opened to them by a great,
wicked-looking Rakshas. She had only one red
eye in the middle of her forehead; her gray
hair hung in a tangled mat over her shoulders,
and she was dressed in dirty rags.
</p>
<p>When the Rakshas saw the brothers she was
filled with fury.
</p>
<p>She considered all the jungle belonged to her,
and she was not willing that any one else should
come there. Her one eye flashed fire, and she
seized a stick and began beating the Princes,
and each one, as she struck him, was turned
into a crow. She then drove them away
and went back into her hut and closed the
door.
</p>
<p>The twenty crows flew back through the forest,
cawing mournfully. When they came to
the tree where their sister sat they gathered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
about her, trying to make her understand that
they were her brothers.
</p>
<p>At first the Princess was frightened by the
crows, but when she saw there were tears in
their eyes, and when she counted them and
found there were exactly twenty, she guessed
what had happened, and that some wicked enchantment
had changed her brothers into this
shape. Then she wept over them and smoothed
their feathers tenderly.
</p>
<p>After this the sister lived up in the tree, and
the crows brought her food every day and rested
around her in the branches at night, so that no
harm should come to her.
</p>
<p>Some time after this a young Rajah came
into that very jungle to hunt. In some way
he became separated from his attendants and
wandered deeper and deeper into the forest,
until at length he came to the tree where the
Princess sat. He threw himself down beneath
the tree to rest. Hearing a sound of wings
above him the Rajah looked up and was
amazed to see a beautiful girl sitting there among
the branches with a flock of crows about her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>The Rajah climbed the tree and brought
the girl down, while the crows circled about his
head, cawing hoarsely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, beautiful one, who are you? And
how come you here in the depths of the jungle?&#8221;
asked the Rajah.
</p>
<p>Weeping, the Princess told him all her story
except that the crows were her brothers; she let
him believe that her brothers had gone off hunting
and had never returned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not weep any more,&#8221; said the Rajah.
&#8220;You shall come home with me and be my
Ranee, and I will have no other but you alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the Princess heard this she smiled,
for the Rajah was very handsome, and already
she loved him.
</p>
<p>She was very glad to go with him and be his
wife. &#8220;But my crows must go with me,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;for they have fed me for many long days
and have been my only companions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>To this the Rajah willingly consented, and he
took her home with him to the palace; and the
crows circled about above them, following
closely all the way.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
The Rajah brought the girl down, while the crows circled<br />
about his head.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>When the old Rajah and Ranee (the young
Rajah&#8217;s father and mother) saw what a very
beautiful girl he had brought back with him
from the jungle they gladly welcomed her as a
daughter-in-law.
</p>
<p>The young Ranee would have been very
happy now in her new life, for she loved her
husband dearly, but always the thought of her
brothers was like a weight upon her heart. She
had a number of trees planted outside her windows
so that her brothers might rest there close
to her. She cooked rice for them herself and
fed them with her own hands, and often she
sat under the trees and stroked them and talked
to them while her tears fell upon their glossy
feathers.
</p>
<p>After a while the young Ranee had a son,
and he was called Ramchundra. He grew up
straight and tall, and he was the joy of his
mother&#8217;s eyes.
</p>
<p>One day, when he was fourteen years old,
and big and strong for his age, he sat in the
garden with his mother. The crows flew down
about them, and she began to caress and talk
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
to them as usual. &#8220;Ah, my dear ones!&#8221; she
cried, &#8220;how sad is your fate! If I could but
release you, how happy I should be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;I can plainly see
that these crows are not ordinary birds. Tell
me whence come they, and why you weep
over them and talk to them as you do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>At first his mother would not tell him, but
in the end she related to him the whole story
of who she was, and how she and her brothers
had come to the jungle and had lived there happily
enough until they were changed into crows;
and then of how the Rajah had found her and
brought her home with him to the palace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can easily see,&#8221; said Ramchundra, when
she had ended the tale, &#8220;that my uncles must
have met a Rakshas somewhere in the forest
and have been enchanted. Tell me exactly
where the tree was&mdash;the tree where you
lived&mdash;and what kind it was?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Ranee told him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And in which direction did your brothers
go when they left you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>This also his mother told him. &#8220;Why do
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
you ask me these questions, my son?&#8221; she
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to know,&#8221; said Ramchundra, &#8220;for
sometime I intend to set out and find that
Rakshas and force her to free my uncles from
her enchantment and change them back to
their natural shapes again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His mother was terrified when she heard this,
but she said very little to him, hoping he would
soon forget about it and not enter into such a
dangerous adventure.
</p>
<p>Not long afterward Ramchundra went to his
father and said, &#8220;Father, I am no longer a
child; give me your permission to ride out into
the world and see it for myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Rajah was willing for him to do this and
asked what attendants his son would take with
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish for no attendants,&#8221; answered Ramchundra.
&#8220;Give me only a horse, and a groom
to take care of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Rajah gave his son the handsomest horse
in his stables and also a well-mounted groom to
ride with him. Ramchundra, however, only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
allowed the groom to go with him as far as the
edge of the jungle, and then he sent him back
home again with both the horses.
</p>
<p>The Prince went on and on through the forest
for a long distance until at last he came to a tree
that he felt sure was the one his mother had
told him of. From there he set forth in the
same direction she told him his uncles had taken.
He went on and on, ever deeper and deeper
into the forest, until at last he came to a miserable
looking hut. The door was open, and he
looked in. There lay an ugly old hag fast
asleep. She had only one eye in the middle of
her forehead, and her gray hair was tangled and
matted and fell over her face. The Prince
entered in very softly, and sitting down beside
her, he began to rub her head. He suspected
that this was the Rakshas who had bewitched
his uncles, and it was indeed she.
</p>
<p>Presently the old woman awoke. &#8220;My
pretty lad,&#8221; said she, &#8220;you have a kind heart.
Stay with me here and help me, for I am very
old and feeble, as you see, and I cannot very
well look out for myself.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>This she said not because she really was old
or feeble, but because she was lazy and wanted
a servant to wait on her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gladly will I stay,&#8221; answered the lad, &#8220;and
what I can do to serve you, that I will do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So the Prince stayed there as the Rakshas&#8217;
servant. He served her hand and foot, and
every day she made him sit down and rub her
head.
</p>
<p>One day, while he was rubbing her head and
she was in a good humor he said to her,
&#8220;Mother, why do you keep all those little jars
of water standing along the wall? Let me
throw out the water so that we may make some
use of the jars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not touch them,&#8221; cried the Rakshas.
&#8220;That water is very powerful. One drop of it
can break the strongest enchantment, and if any
one has been bewitched, that water has power
to bring him back to his own shape again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And why do you keep that crooked stick
behind the door? To-morrow I shall break it
up to build a fire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not touch it,&#8221; cried the hag. &#8220;I have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
but to wave that stick, and I can conjure up a
mountain, a forest, or a river just as I wish,
and all in the twinkling of an eye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Prince said nothing to that, but went on
rubbing her head. Presently he began to talk
again. &#8220;Your hair is in a dreadful tangle,
mother,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Let me get a comb and
comb it out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not dare!&#8221; screamed the Rakshas.
&#8220;One hair of my head has the power to set the
whole jungle in flames.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ramchundra again was silent and went on
rubbing her head, and after a while the old
Rakshas fell asleep and snored till the hut
shook with her snoring.
</p>
<p>Then, very quietly, the Prince arose. He
plucked a hair from the old hag&#8217;s head without
awakening her, he took a flask of the magic
water and the staff from behind the door, and
set out as fast as he could go in the direction of
the palace.
</p>
<p>It was not long before he heard the Rakshas
coming through the jungle after him, for she had
awakened and found him gone.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>Nearer and nearer she came, and then the
Prince turned and waved the crooked stick. At
once a river rolled between him and the Rakshas.
</p>
<p>Without pause the Rakshas plunged into the
river and struck out boldly, and soon she
reached the other side.
</p>
<p>On she came again close after Ramchundra.
Again he turned and waved the staff. At once
a thick screen of trees sprang up between him
and the hag. The Rakshas brushed them aside
this way and that as though they had been
nothing but twigs.
</p>
<p>On she came, and again the Prince waved the
staff. A high mountain arose, but the Rakshas
climbed it, and it did not take her long to do
this.
</p>
<p>Now she was so close that Ramchundra could
hear her panting, but the edge of the jungle
had been reached. He turned and cast the
Rakshas&#8217; hair behind him. Immediately the
whole jungle burst into fire, and the Rakshas
was burned up in the flames.
</p>
<p>Soon after the Prince reached the palace and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
hastened out into the garden. There sat his
mother weeping, with the crows gathered about
her. When she saw Ramchundra she sprang
to her feet with a scream of joy and ran to him
and took him in her arms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My son! my son! I thought you had
perished!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Did you meet the
Rakshas?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only did I meet her, but I have slain
her and brought back with me that which will
restore my uncles to their proper shapes,&#8221; answered
the Prince.
</p>
<p>He then dipped his fingers into the jar he
carried and sprinkled the magic water over
the crows. At once the enchantment was
broken, and the twenty Princes stood there,
tall and handsome, in their own proper shapes.
</p>
<p>The Ranee made haste to lead them to her
husband and told him the whole story. The
Rajah could not wonder enough when he understood
that the Princes were his wife&#8217;s brothers,
and were the crows she had brought home with
her.
</p>
<p>He at once ordered a magnificent feast to be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
prepared and a day of rejoicing to be held
throughout all the kingdom.
</p>
<p>Many Rajahs from far and near were invited
to the feast, and among those who came was
the father of the Ranee and her brothers, but
he never suspected, as he looked upon them,
that they were his children.
</p>
<p>Before they sat down to the feast the young
Ranee said to him, &#8220;Where is your wife Guzra
Bai? Why has she not come with you? We
had expected to see her here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Rajah was surprised that the young Ranee
should know his wife&#8217;s name, but he made some
excuse as to why Guzra Bai was not there.
</p>
<p>Then the young Rajah said, &#8220;Send for her, I
beg of you, for the feast cannot begin till she
is here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The older Rajah was still more surprised at
this. He could not think any one was really
concerned about Guzra Bai, and he feared the
young Rajah wished, for some reason, to quarrel
with him. But he agreed to send for his wife,
and messengers were at once dispatched to
bring Guzra Bai to the palace.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>No sooner had she come than the young
Ranee began to weep, and she and the Princes
gathered about their mother. Then they told
the Rajah the whole story of how his mother
and the nurse had sought to destroy Guzra Bai
and her children, and how they had been saved,
and had now come to safety and great honor.
</p>
<p>The Rajah was overcome with joy when he
found that Guzra Bai was innocent. He prayed
her to forgive him, and this she did, and all was
joy and happiness.
</p>
<p>As for the old Ranee, she was shut up in the
tower where Guzra Bai had lived for so many
years, but the old nurse was killed as befitted
such a wicked woman.

<h2>LIFE&#8217;S SECRET</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Story of Bengal</span></h3>
</div>

<p>In a far-off country there once lived a great
Rajah who had two wives, one named Duo and
the other Suo. Both these Ranees were beautiful,
but Duo was of a harsh and cruel nature,
while Suo was gentle and kind to all.
</p>
<p>Though the Rajah had been married to his
Ranees for some time they neither of them had
any children, and this was a great grief to every
one. Daily prayers were offered up in the temples
for the birth of a son to the Rajah, but the
prayers remained unanswered.
</p>
<p>One day a beggar, a holy man who had vowed
to live in poverty, came to the palace asking for
alms. Duo would have had him driven away,
but Suo felt compassion for him. She gave
him the alms he asked and bade him sit in the
cool of the courtyard to rest.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>The beggar thanked her and ate the food she
gave him. Just before he left, he asked to
speak to her in private. This favor Suo granted
him. She stepped aside with him, and as it so
happened this brought them directly under the
windows of Duo&#8217;s apartments.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Ranee, you have been very kind to
me,&#8221; said the beggar, &#8220;and I wish to reward
you. I know that for years you have desired
to have a son, but that this wish has not been
granted. Now listen! In the midst of the
jungle over beyond the city there grows the
most wonderful tree in all the world. Its
trunk is silver, and its leaves are of gold. Once
in every hundred years this tree bears a single
crimson fruit. She who eats this fruit, whosoever
she may be, shall, within a year, bear a
son. This is that hundredth year,&mdash;the year
in which the tree bears fruit, and I have gathered
that fruit and have it here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So saying, the beggar drew from among his
rags a piece of silk embroidered with strange
figures. This he unfolded, and showed to the
Ranee, lying within it, a strange fruit such as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
she had never seen before. It was pear shaped,
and of such a vivid red that it seemed to pulse
and glow with light.
</p>
<p>Suo looked at it with wonder and awe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you wish to have it, it is yours,&#8221; the
beggar continued. &#8220;But I must tell you one
other thing. Whoever eats this fruit shall indeed
bear a son, but he will not be as other
children. His life will not be altogether within
himself as with other people; it will be bound
up with an object quite outside of himself. If
this object should fall into the hands of an
enemy that enemy could, by willing it, bring
upon him misfortune or even death, and this
no matter how closely the child was watched
and guarded. And now, knowing this, do you
still wish to eat the fruit?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes!&#8221; cried Suo.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will tell you what this object is and
where it is to be found,&#8221; said the beggar. He
drew still closer to the Ranee and whispered
in her ear, but though what he told her
was so important Suo paid but little attention
to it; she thought only of the fruit,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
and the happiness that might come to her
if she ate it.
</p>
<p>Now all the while the beggar had been talking
to Suo, Duo had been seated at her window just
above them, and she overheard all that was
said. Only when the beggar came closer to Suo
and whispered in her ear Duo could not hear
what he said, though she leaned out as far as
she could and strained her ears to listen. So,
though she had learned that if Suo had a child
its life would depend on some object outside of
itself, she did not learn what that object was.
</p>
<p>The beggar now gave the fruit to Suo, and
she took it and ate all of it. Not one seed or
bit of rind did she miss. After that she went
back to her own apartments to dream upon the
joy that might be coming to her.
</p>
<p>Within the year, even as the beggar had
promised, Suo bore a child, and this child was
so large and strong and handsome that he was
the wonder of all who saw him.
</p>
<p>The Rajah was wild with joy. He could
scarcely think or talk of anything but his son,
and he showered gifts and caresses upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
happy mother. Duo was quite forgotten. He
never even went near her apartments, and her
heart was filled with jealousy and hatred toward
Suo and the little prince Dalim Kumar,&mdash;for
so the child was named. Nothing would
have given her more joy than to be able to
injure them and bring sorrow and misfortune
upon them.
</p>
<p>Now as Dalim Kumar grew older he became
very fond of a flock of pigeons that his father
had given him, and he spent a great deal of
time playing with them in the courtyard. They
were so tame they would come at his call and
light upon his head and shoulders. Sometimes
they flew in through the windows of Duo&#8217;s
apartments which overlooked the courtyard.
Duo scattered peas and grain on the floor for
them, and they came and ate them. Then one
day she caught two or three of them.
</p>
<p>Soon after Dalim Kumar missed his pigeons
and began calling them.
</p>
<p>Duo leaned from her window. &#8220;Your pigeons
are up here,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;If you want them
you must come up and get them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>Suo had forbidden her son to go to Duo&#8217;s
apartments, but he quite forgot this in his
eagerness to regain his pets, and he at once ran
up to the Ranee&#8217;s apartments.
</p>
<p>Duo took him by the wrist and drew him
into her room. &#8220;You shall have your pigeons
again,&#8221; said she, &#8220;but first there is something
you must tell me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Dalim Kumar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to know where your life lies and in
what object it is bound up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dalim Kumar was very much surprised. &#8220;I
do not know what you mean,&#8221; said he. &#8220;My
life lies within me, in my head and my body
and my limbs, as it is with every one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that is not so,&#8221; said Duo. &#8220;Has your
mother never told you that your life is bound
up in something outside of yourself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, she has never told me that, and moreover
I do not believe it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless it is so,&#8221; said Duo. &#8220;If you
will find out what this thing is and come and
tell me you shall have your pigeons again, and
if you do not do this I will wring their necks.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></p>
<p>Dalim Kumar was greatly troubled at the
thought of harm coming to his pigeons. &#8220;No,
no! You must not do that,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I will
go to my mother and find out what she knows,
and if there is indeed truth in what you say I
will come back at once and tell you the secret.
But you must do nothing to my pigeons while
I am gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>To this Duo agreed. &#8220;There is another
thing you must promise,&#8221; said she. &#8220;You must
not let your mother know I have asked you anything
about your life. If you do I will wring
your pigeons&#8217; necks even though you tell me
the secret.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not let her know,&#8221; promised the boy,
and then he hastened away to his mother&#8217;s
apartments. When he came to the door he
began to walk slowly and with dragging steps.
He entered in and threw himself down among
some cushions and closed his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What ails you, my son?&#8221; asked his mother.
&#8220;Why do you sit there so quietly instead of
playing about?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing ails me now,&#8221; answered the boy,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
&#8220;but there is something that I wish to know, and
unless you tell me I am sure I shall be quite ill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it that you wish to know, my darling?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to know where my life lies, and in
what it is bound up,&#8221; answered the boy.
</p>
<p>When Suo heard this she was very much
frightened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Who
has been talking to you of your life?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Dalim said what was not true, for he
feared that harm might come to his pigeons.
&#8220;No one has been talking to me,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;but I am sure that my life lies somewhere
outside of me, and if you will not tell me about
it I will neither eat nor drink, and then perhaps
I may die.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At last Suo could withstand him no longer.
&#8220;My son,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it is as you have guessed.
You are not as other children. Your life is
bound up in some object outside of yourself,
and if this object should fall into the hands of
an enemy the greatest misfortunes might come
upon you, and perhaps even death.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And what is this object?&#8221; asked the boy.
</p>
<p>Again Suo hesitated. Then she said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;The beggar told me that under the roots of
that same tree that bore the fruit lies buried a
golden necklace, and it is with that necklace
that part of your life is bound up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Now that Dalim Kumar knew the secret he
was content, and smiled upon his mother and
caressed her, and ate some of the sweetmeats
she had prepared for him. Then he ran away
to get his pigeons.
</p>
<p>Duo was waiting for him impatiently.
&#8220;Have you found out the secret of your life?&#8221;
she demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the Prince. &#8220;It is bound
up in a golden necklace that lies buried under
the roots of a tree over in the jungle,&mdash;a tree
with a silver trunk and golden leaves. And
now give me my pigeons.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Duo was very willing to do this; she had no
longer any use for them. She placed the cage
in which she had put them in his hands and
pushed him impatiently from the room.
</p>
<p>As soon as the boy had gone the Ranee sent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
for a man upon whom she could depend and
told him what she wished him to do. She
wished him to go into the jungle and search
until he found a tree with a silver trunk and
golden leaves. He was then to dig down about
its roots until he found a golden necklace that
lay buried there. This necklace he was to
bring to her, and in return for his services she
would give him a lac of gold mohurs.
</p>
<p>The man willingly agreed to do as she wished
and at once set out into the jungle. After
searching for some time he at last found the
tree and began to dig about its roots.
</p>
<p>Now at the very time this happened Dalim
Kumar was with his mother playing about in
her apartment. But no sooner did the man in
the jungle begin to dig about the tree than the
boy gave a cry and laid his hand upon his
heart. At the same time he became very pale.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter, my son?&#8221; cried his
mother anxiously. &#8220;Are you ill?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know what is the matter,&#8221; answered
the Prince, &#8220;but something threatens
me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>His mother put her arm about him, and at
the very moment she did so the man who had
been digging found the necklace and picked it
up, and at that the young Prince sank back
senseless in his mother&#8217;s arms.
</p>
<p>The Ranee was terrified. She sent at once
for the Rajah, and physicians were called in,
but none of them could arouse the child nor
could they tell what ailed him. He lay there
among the cushions where they had placed him
still breathing, but unconscious of all around
him.
</p>
<p>And so the boy lay all the while that the
man with the necklace hidden in his bosom was
on his way back from the jungle. But when
he reached the apartments of Duo and gave
the necklace into the hands of the evil Ranee,
the breath went out from the Prince&#8217;s body,
and he became as one dead.
</p>
<p>The Rajah was in despair. His grief was
now as great as his joy had been when the
child was born. He had a magnificent temple
built in the most beautiful of all his gardens,
and in this temple the body of Dalim Kumar
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
was laid. After this was done the Rajah commanded
that the gates of the garden should be
locked, and that no one but the gardeners
should ever enter there on pain of death.
</p>
<p>This command was carried out. The garden
gates were kept locked, and no one entered but
the men who went there in the daytime to
prune the trees and water the flowers and keep
the place in order. Not even Suo might go
into the garden to mourn beside the body of
her son.
</p>
<p>But though every one believed Dalim Kumar
to be dead, such was not really the case. All
day, while Duo wore the necklace, he lay without
breath or sign of life, but in the evening,
when the Ranee took the necklace off, he revived
and returned to life. And this happened
every night, for every night the Rajah came to
visit Duo, and just before he came she always
took the necklace off and hid it. She feared if
he saw it he might wonder and question her
about it.
</p>
<p>The wicked Ranee was now satisfied and
happy. She believed she had destroyed the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
young Prince, and with him the Rajah&#8217;s love
for Suo. For the Rajah now never went to
Suo&#8217;s apartments. He neither saw her nor
spoke of her, for she only reminded him of his
grief for his son.
</p>
<p>Now the first time that Dalim Kumar awoke
in the temple he was very much surprised to
find himself alone in a strange place, and with
no attendants around him. He arose and went
out into the garden, and then at once he knew
where he was, though the temple was new to
him. He went to one gate after another of the
garden, intending to go and return to the
palace, but he found them all locked. The
gardeners had gone away for the night, and
before going they had securely fastened the
gates, according to the Rajah&#8217;s orders. The
young prince called and called, but no one heard
or answered. Feeling hungry, he plucked some
fruit and ate it, and after that he amused himself
as best he could, playing about among the
trees and flowers.
</p>
<p>Toward morning he felt sleepy and returned
to the temple. He lay down upon the couch,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
and later on, when Duo again put on the necklace,
his breath left him, and he became as one
dead.
</p>
<p>As it had been that night, so it was also in
the many nights that followed. In the evening
the Prince revived and came out to play among
the flowers, but with the coming of day he returned
to the temple and lay down on the
couch, and all appearance of life left him.
After a time he became used to the strange life
he led, and no longer wondered why he was left
there alone and why no one came to seek him.
</p>
<p>So year after year slipped by, and from a
child the Prince became a youth, and in all that
time he had seen no one, for the gardeners had
always gone away before he returned to life.
</p>
<p>Now there lived at this time, in a country
far away, a woman who had one only child, a
daughter named Surai Bai. This girl was so
beautiful that she was the wonder of all who
saw her. Her hair was as black as night, her
eyes like stars, her teeth like pearls, and her
lips as red as ripe pomegranates.
</p>
<p>When this child was born it was foretold to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
her mother that she would sometime marry a
Prince who was both alive and dead. This
prophecy frightened the mother so much that
as soon as her daughter was of a marriageable
age she left her own country and journeyed
away into a far land, taking the girl with her.
She hoped that if she went far enough she might
escape the fate that had been foretold for the
child.
</p>
<p>Journeying on from one place to another,
she came at last to the city where Dalim
Kumar&#8217;s father reigned, and where the garden
was, and the temple where the young prince
lay.
</p>
<p>It was toward evening when the mother and
daughter reached the city, and it was necessary
for them to find some shelter for the night.
Surai Bai was weary, and her mother bade her
sit down and rest by the gate of one of the
palace gardens while she went farther to seek a
lodging. As soon as she had found a place
where they could stay she would return for the
girl.
</p>
<p>So Surai Bai seated herself beside the gate,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
and there her mother left her. But the mother
had not been gone long when some noise farther
up the street frightened the girl. She looked
about for a place to hide, and it occurred to her
that she might go into the garden and wait
there. She tried the gate and found it unfastened,
for by some chance one of the gardeners
had forgotten to lock it that evening
when he went away.
</p>
<p>Surai Bai pushed the gate open and stepped
inside, closing it behind her. When she looked
about her, she was amazed at the beauty of the
garden. The fruit trees were laden with fruits
of every kind. There were winding paths and
flowers and fountains, and in the midst of the
garden was a temple shining with gold and
wondrous colors.
</p>
<p>Though daylight had faded the moon had
arisen, and the garden was full of light. Surai
Bai went over close to the temple, wishing to
examine it, but just as she reached the foot of
the steps that led up to it a young man appeared
above her at the door of the temple. It was
Dalim Kumar, who had aroused again to life
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
and was coming forth to breathe the air of the
garden.
</p>
<p>When he saw Surai Bai he stood amazed, not
only at her beauty, which was so great, but
because hers was the first face he had ever seen
in the years he had spent in the garden. As
for Surai Bai, never before had she beheld a
youth so handsome, or with such a noble air,
and as the two stood looking at each other they
became filled with love for one another.
</p>
<p>Presently Dalim Kumar came down the steps
of the temple and took Surai Bai&#8217;s hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you, beautiful one?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;Whence come you, and what is your name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Surai Bai,&#8221; answered the girl,
&#8220;and I come from another country far away.
My mother left me sitting by the gate while
she went to find a lodging for us, but some noise
frightened me, and I ran in here to hide.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a strange thing,&#8221; said the Prince.
&#8220;In all the years I have been living here, the
gates have never been unlocked before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But do you live here alone?&#8221; asked the
girl.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, all alone. Yours is the first face I
have seen for years, and yet I am a Prince, and
the son of a great Rajah.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why are you here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am here because my life was bound up in
a golden necklace that lay buried under the
roots of a tree in the jungle. I told the secret
to a Ranee who was my enemy, though I did
not know it at the time. She must in some
way have gained possession of the necklace,
and now she is using it for my harm. All day
I lie there in the temple as though dead; no
sound reaches me, nothing arouses me; only
at night can I arise and come forth. I, a great
prince, am as one both dead and alive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When Dalim Kumar pronounced these words
Surai Bai could not refrain from giving a loud
cry. She was overcome with amazement and
confusion.
</p>
<p>The Prince at once wished to know what
had moved her so. &#8220;Why do you cry out and
change color?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;And why do you
tremble and look at me so strangely?&#8221;
</p>
<p>At first Surai Bai would not tell him, but he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
was so urgent in his questioning that finally she
was obliged to recount to him the prophecy
made at the time of her birth;&mdash;that it had
been foretold of her that she was to marry a
Prince who was both alive and dead.
</p>
<p>Dalim Kumar listened to her attentively.
&#8220;That is a strange thing,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I do not
suppose in all the world there is another prince
beside myself who is both alive and dead. If
this saying is true, it must be that I am the
one you are to marry. If so, I am very happy,
for already I love you, and if you will stay here
with me we will be married by the ceremony of
Grandharva, and I will be a true and loving
husband to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>To this Surai Bai willingly consented, for already
she loved the prince so dearly that she
felt she could not live without him. That very
night she and the Prince presented each other
with garlands of flowers, for that is the ceremony
of Grandharva, and so they became man
and wife.
</p>
<p>After that they lived together in great happiness,
and nothing could exceed their love
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
for each other. By day, while Dalim Kumar
lay lifeless in the temple, his bride slept
also, and at evening they awoke and talked
together and walked through the garden.
</p>
<p>But after a while a son was born to the young
couple, and after that Surai Bai was no longer
gay and happy. Her look was sad, and often
she stole away from Dalim Kumar to weep in
secret.
</p>
<p>The Prince was greatly troubled by this. At
first he forbore to question her, but one day
he followed her and finding her in tears, he said,
&#8220;Tell me, why are you sad and downcast?
Have you wearied of this garden, and are you
lonely here; or is it that you no longer love
me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dalim Kumar,&#8221; answered the girl, &#8220;I love
you as dearly as ever, and I am never lonely
with you. As long as we had no child I was
content to stay here in the garden and see no
one. But now that we have a son I wish him
to be seen by your people, and I wish them to
know that he is the heir to the kingdom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this Dalim Kumar became very thoughtful.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
&#8220;My dear wife,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you are right.
Our son should be known as my heir; but
every one believes I died long ago when I was a
child. If you went out among them with the
boy and told them he was my son, they would
laugh at you, and either think you were an
impostor or that you were crazy. If we could
but gain possession of the necklace, then I
could go out from the garden with you, and if
I showed myself to my people they would be
obliged to believe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what I have thought also,&#8221; said
Surai Bai, &#8220;and it has been in my mind to ask
you to give me permission to leave the garden
for a while. If you will do this I will try to
gain entrance to the palace and the apartments
of Duo. Then possibly I can find where she
keeps the necklace at night, and I may be able
to get possession of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dalim Kumar eagerly agreed to this plan,
and the very next day, while he lay unconscious
in the temple, Surai Bai took the child
and managed to steal out through one of the
gates without being seen by any of the gardeners.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></p>
<p>She at once sought out a shop in the city and
bought for herself the dress of a hairdresser;
then, leading the child by the hand she made
her way to the palace. She told the attendants
there that she was very skillful in dressing the
hair, and if they would take her to the Ranees
she was sure she could please them.
</p>
<p>After some hesitation the attendants agreed
to do this, and led the way first to the apartments
of Suo. When Surai Bai entered the
room and saw her husband&#8217;s mother sitting
there thin and pale and grief-stricken, her
heart yearned over her. But Suo would not
so much as look at the pretended hairdresser.
&#8220;Why do you bring her here?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I
have no wish to look beautiful. My son is
dead and my husband no longer loves me nor
comes to me. Take her away and leave me
alone with my sorrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The attendants motioned to Surai Bai to
come away, and they led her across the palace
to the apartments of Duo.
</p>
<p>Here all was bright and joyous. The beautiful
Duo lay among the cushions, smiling to herself
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
and playing with the necklace that hung
about her neck. When she heard that the
young woman they had brought to her was a
skilled hairdresser, she sat up and beckoned
Surai Bai to approach.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; said she. &#8220;Let us see how well
you can dress my hair. The Rajah will be
here before long, and I must be beautiful for
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Surai Bai at once came behind Duo and began
to arrange her hair. The child meanwhile
kept close by her side. When Surai Bai had
almost finished she managed to loosen the clasp
of the necklace so that it slipped from Duo&#8217;s
neck and fell upon the floor.
</p>
<p>This was as the pretended hairdresser had
planned, and she had explained to her son beforehand
that when the necklace fell he must
pick it up and hold it tight, and yield it to no
one. So now, no sooner did the necklace slip
to the floor, than the child picked it up and
twisted it tight around his fingers.
</p>
<p>Duo was frightened. &#8220;Give me my necklace,&#8221;
cried she, and reaching over she tried to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
take it from the boy, but at this he began to
scream so loudly that it seemed as though the
whole palace must be aroused by his cries.
</p>
<p>Duo drew back alarmed and bade the child
be quiet. Then she turned to the pretended
hairdresser. &#8220;Make him give me the necklace
again,&#8221; she demanded.
</p>
<p>Surai Bai pretended to hesitate. &#8220;If I try
to take it from him now,&#8221; she said, &#8220;he might
break it. Have patience, and let him keep it
for a while; he will soon tire of it. Then I can
take it from him and bring it to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>To this Duo was obliged to agree. It was
growing late and she feared at any moment now
the Rajah might come in and that he might
notice the necklace in the child&#8217;s hands and ask
questions about it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Let him keep it for
the present, but bring it back to me the first
thing in the morning. If you neglect to do this
you shall be severely punished,&mdash;you and the
child also.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The pretended hairdresser made a deep
obeisance, and then departed, carrying the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
child who still held the necklace tightly clutched
in his hands.
</p>
<p>As soon as Surai Bai was outside of the
palace she hastened away to the garden and
found Dalim Kumar awaiting her at the gate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you have the necklace,&#8221; he cried to
her, &#8220;for I aroused while it was still day, and
with such a feeling of life and joy as I have
never felt before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is here,&#8221; said Surai Bai, and she
took the necklace from the child and held it
out to him.
</p>
<p>Dalim Kumar gave a cry of joy. His hands
trembled with eagerness as he grasped the necklace.
&#8220;Oh, my dear wife,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;you have
saved me. I have now again become as other
men and can claim what is my own. Come!
Let us return to the palace and to my father
and mother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So, with the child on his arm, and leading
Surai Bai by the hand, the Prince hastened
back to the palace. But when he entered the
gates no one knew him, for when they had
last seen him he had been only a boy. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
wondered to see a stranger enter in like a master,
but his air was so noble, and his appearance
so handsome that no one dared to stop him.
</p>
<p>Dalim Kumar went at once to his mother&#8217;s
apartments, and though no one else had known
him, she recognized him at once, even though he
had become a man. She knew not what miracle
had brought him back, but she fell upon his neck
and kissed him, and wept aloud, so that all in
the palace heard the sound of her weeping.
</p>
<p>The Rajah was sent for in haste, and when
he came Dalim Kumar quickly made himself
known to his father. The Rajah&#8217;s joy was no
less than the Ranee&#8217;s over the return of his son.
</p>
<p>Soon the news spread through all the palace,
and there was great rejoicing. But Duo was
filled with fear. She knew not what punishment
would fall upon her for her evil doings,
but she guessed the wrath of the Rajah would
be great. So she fled away secretly and in
haste, and for a long time she wandered about
from place to place, miserable and afraid, and
at last died in poverty as she deserved.
</p>
<p>But Dalim Kumar and his young wife lived
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
in happiness forever after, and when the old
Rajah died Dalim Kumar became Rajah in his
stead, and his own son ruled after him as Surai
Bai and he had desired.

<h2>DAME PRIDGETT AND THE FAIRIES</h2>
</div>

<p>Dame Pridgett was a fat, comfortable, good-natured
old body, and her business in life was
to go about nursing sick folk and making them
well again.
</p>
<p>One day she was sitting by the window, rocking
herself and resting after a hard week of
nursing. She looked from the window, and
there she saw a queer-looking little man come
riding along the road on a great fiery, prancing
black horse. He rode up to her door and
knocked without getting off his horse, and when
Dame Pridgett opened the door he looked down
at her with such queer pale eyes he almost
frightened her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you Dame Pridgett?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; answered the dame.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And do you go about nursing sick people?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that is my business.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then you are the one I want. My wife is
ill, and I am seeking some one to nurse her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you live?&#8221; asked the dame, for
the man was a stranger to her, and she knew
he was not from thereabouts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I come from over beyond the hills, but
I have no time to talk. Give me your hand
and mount up behind me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dame Pridgett gave him her hand, not because
she wanted to, but because, somehow,
when he bade her do so she could not refuse.
He gave her hand a little pull, and she flew up
through the air as light as a bird, and there
she was sitting on the horse behind him. The
stranger whistled, and away went the great
black horse, fast, fast as the wind;&mdash;so fast
that the old Dame had much ado not to be
blown off, but she shut her eyes and held tight
to the stranger.
</p>
<p>They rode along for what seemed a long distance,
and then they stopped before a poor,
mean-looking house. Dame Pridgett stared
about her, and she did not know where they
were. She knew she had never seen the place
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
before. In front of the house were some rocks
with weeds growing among them, and a pool of
muddy water, and a few half-dead trees. It
was a dreary place. Two ragged children were
playing beside the door with a handful of
pebbles.
</p>
<p>The little man lighted down and helped the
old dame slip from the horse; then he led the
way into the house. They passed through a
mean hallway and into a room hung round
with cobwebs. The room was poorly furnished
with a wooden bed, a table and a few chairs.
In the bed lay a little, round-faced woman with
a snub nose and a coarse, freckled skin, and in
the crook of her arm was a baby so small and
weak-looking the nurse knew it could not be
more than a few hours old.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my wife,&#8221; said the stranger. &#8220;It
will be your duty to wait on her and to wash
and dress the child.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The baby was so queer looking that Dame
Pridgett did not much care to handle it, but
still she had come there as a nurse, and she
would do what was required of her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></p>
<p>The little man showed her where the kitchen
was, and she heated some water and then went
back to the bedroom and took up the baby to
wash it. But so strange it all seemed, and she
felt so shaken up by her ride that she was
awkward in handling the child, and as she bent
her head over it, it lifted its hand and gave
her such a box on the ear that her head rang
with it.
</p>
<p>The old dame cried out and almost let the
babe fall, she was so thunderstruck.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; asked the woman
from the bed. Then she slipped her hand under
her pillow and drew out a box of salve. &#8220;Here!
Rub the child&#8217;s eyes with a bit of this,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;but be sure you do not get any of it on your
own eyes, or it will be a bad thing for you,&mdash;scarce
could be a worse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The nurse took a bit of the salve on her forefinger
and rubbed the baby&#8217;s eyes with it, and
then the mother bade her go and wash off any
particle of salve that might be left on her finger.
</p>
<p>All day Dame Pridgett waited on the mother
and child, and when night came she was shown
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
into a room next to theirs where she was to
sleep.
</p>
<p>The following day the dame was again kept
busy with the mother and child. She washed
the baby and rubbed the salve on its eyelids as
before, and again the mother warned her not to
let the least particle of salve touch her own
eyes, or it would be the worse for her.
</p>
<p>Food was set out for the nurse in a small
room beyond her own. She did not know
whence it came, nor who prepared it, but she
was hungry and ate heartily of it, though it had
a strange taste she did not like. The two
ragged children came in and ate with her.
They did not speak, but stared at her from
under their matted hair. The little man she
did not see again for some time.
</p>
<p>So day followed day, and it was always the
same thing over and over for Dame Pridgett,
and every day after she had washed the child
she rubbed salve on its eyelids. Soon its eyes,
that had at first been dull, grew so bright and
strong they sparkled like jewels. Dame Pridgett
thought it must be a very fine salve. She
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
would have liked to try some of it on her own
eyes, for her sight was somewhat dim, but the
mother watched her so closely that she never
had a chance to use it.
</p>
<p>Now, every day, after Dame Pridgett had
washed the baby, she left the basin on a chair
beside her while she rubbed the salve on the
child&#8217;s eyes. One day she managed to upset
the basin with her elbow as though by accident,
though really by design. She gave a cry and
bent over to pick up the basin, and as she did
so, unseen by her mistress, she rubbed her right
eye with the finger that still had some salve
left on it.
</p>
<p>When Dame Pridgett straightened up and
looked about her she could hardly keep from
crying out again at what she saw. The room
and everything in it looked different. Instead
of being poor and mean, it was like a chamber
in a castle. Where there had been cobwebs
were now shimmering silken hangings. The
bed and all the furniture was of gold, magnificently
carved. The sheets and pillow cases
were of silk, and instead of a coarse, snub-nosed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
little woman, there among the pillows lay the
most exquisite little lady the old dame had ever
set eyes on; her skin was as fine as a rose leaf,
her hair like spun gold, her lips like coral, and
her eyes as bright as stars. The babe, also,
from being a very ordinary looking child, had
become the most exquisite little elfin creature
that ever was seen.
</p>
<p>Dame Pridgett managed somehow to keep
quiet and hide her amazement, but now she
knew very well that it was to fairyland she had
come, and that these were fairy folk.
</p>
<p>She made some excuse to go to the window
and look out. The change outside was no less
wonderful than that within. The muddy pool
she now saw was a shining lake; the rocks were
grottoes; the trees were covered with leaves
and shining fruit, and the weeds were beds of
flowers of wondrous colors, such as she had
never seen before. As for the ragged children,
she saw them now as fairy children clothed in
the finest of laces and playing, not with pebbles,
but with precious jewels so brilliant that they
fairly dazzled the eyes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></p>
<p>Dame Pridgett managed to keep her mouth
shut and acted in such a way that the fairies
never suspected she had used the magic ointment,
and could now see them as they were.
But it was only with the right eye, the one she
had touched with the salve, that she could see
thus. When she closed that eye and looked
with the other, everything was just as it had
been before, and seemed so mean and squalid
it was difficult to believe it could appear otherwise.
</p>
<p>So time went on until the fairy lady was
well again and had no need of a nurse to care
for her. Then one day the little man came
again on his black steed and called the old
dame out to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have served us well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and
here is your reward,&#8221; and he placed a purse of
gold pieces in her hand. Then he caught hold
of her and lifted her up behind him on to the
horse, and away they went, swifter than the
wind. Dame Pridgett had to shut her eyes to
keep from growing dizzy and falling off. So it
was that when she reached home she knew no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
more of the way she had come than she knew
of the way she had gone.
</p>
<p>But this was not the last Dame Pridgett saw
of the fairy folk. The little man on the black
steed came to her house no more, but there were
other little people about in the world who were
now visible to her salve-touched eye. Sometimes
as she came through the wood she would
see them busy among the roots of the trees,
setting their houses in order, or bartering and
trading in their fairy markets; or on moonlight
nights she would look out and see them at
play among the flowers in her garden; or she
would pass them dancing in fairy rings in the
pastures or meadow lands, but she never told
a soul of what she saw, nor tried to speak to
the wee folk, and they were so busy about their
own affairs that they paid no attention to her
and never guessed she could see them.
</p>
<p>And then at last came a day (and a sad day
it was for Dame Pridgett) when she again met
the little man who had come for her on the
great black horse.
</p>
<p>She had gone to market to buy the stuff for a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
new apron and was walking along, thinking of
nothing but her purchase, when suddenly she
saw the little man slipping about among the
market people, never touching them and unseen
by any. He was peeping into the butter firkins,
smelling and tasting, and wherever he found
some very good butter he helped himself to a
bit of it and put it in a basket he carried on
his arm.
</p>
<p>Dame Pridgett pressed up close to him and
looked into his basket, and there in it was a
dish almost full of butter. When the good
dame saw that, she was so indignant that she
quite lost all prudence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shame on you,&#8221; she cried to the little man.
&#8220;Are you not ashamed to be stealing butter from
good folk who are less able to buy than yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The little man stopped and looked at her.
&#8220;So you can see me, can you?&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, to be sure I can,&#8221; said the old dame
boldly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And how does that happen?&#8221; asked the
little man smoothly, and without any show of
anger.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, when I was nursing your good lady, I
managed to rub a bit of her salve on one of my
eyes, and that is how I can see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And which eye did you rub with the salve?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My right eye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it is only with your right eye you see
me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only with my right eye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the little man heard that, quick as a
flash he pursed up his lips and blew into her
right eye, and he blew so hard he blew the sight
right out of it. The old dame blinked and
winked and rubbed her eye with her fingers.
The little man had vanished from before her.
She could see everything else, but what she saw
was with her left eye only, and she could see no
fairies with it for it had not been touched with
salve.
</p>
<p>So that was the end of it for Dame Pridgett,
as far as the wee folk were concerned, for she
never got back the sight of her right eye; only
she still had the purse of gold pieces left, and
that was enough to comfort the old dame for a
great deal.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
